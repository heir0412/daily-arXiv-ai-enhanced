### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），覆盖12个偏见类别和5个评估任务，填补了中文偏见评估数据集的空白，并评估了多个流行大语言模型的偏见程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估数据集主要针对英语和北美文化，中文数据集稀缺且功能单一，无法全面评估大语言模型的偏见。

Method: 构建了包含4,077个偏见评估实例的McBE基准，涵盖12个偏见类别和5个评估任务。

Result: 评估的多个大语言模型均表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: McBE为中文偏见评估提供了全面工具，揭示了LLMs的偏见问题，为未来研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了推理型与非推理型大语言模型在对话摘要任务中的表现，发现逐步推理并未显著提升摘要质量，反而可能导致冗长和不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话摘要在实际应用中价值显著，但推理型大语言模型（如Long Chain-of-Thought）在此任务中的表现尚未被系统评估。

Method: 通过三种范式（通用、角色导向和查询导向）和多种语言、领域及摘要长度，对推理型与非推理型模型进行全面评估。

Result: 逐步推理在对话摘要中未显示一致优势，推理型模型易产生冗长和不一致问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前推理型模型的局限性，强调需要针对实际对话摘要任务优化建模和评估策略。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了Huginn-3.5B模型是否在内部形成潜在推理结构，发现其潜在推理能力有限且不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度循环Transformer是否能在内部实现潜在推理（latent CoT），以提升效率。

Method: 使用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等技术对模型在算术任务中的内部行为进行分析。

Result: 发现潜在推理的证据有限，且不同循环块的探测结果不一致；增加循环深度仅带来边际提升。

Conclusion: 潜在推理在Huginn-3.5B中表现不佳，显式推理步骤仍更有效。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot是一个开源工具，通过自然语言描述自动生成GDC队列过滤器，帮助用户更轻松地创建复杂队列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDC用户（尤其是新手）在通过图形界面创建复杂队列时，可能难以在数百个字段中找到特定描述符，而自然语言描述可能更直观。

Method: 开发并评估了多种大型语言模型（LLMs），本地部署的开源GDC Cohort LLM在生成队列时表现优于GPT-4o。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot能够根据用户输入的自然语言描述自动生成队列过滤器，并通过交互界面进一步优化。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot为GDC用户提供了一种更直观、高效的队列创建方式，开源模型表现优于商业模型。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.
Source code is available at https://github.com/uc-cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot. GDC

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu,Tinghong Chen,Jiangtao Feng,Jiangjie Chen,Weinan Dai,Qiying Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Jingjing Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemAgent通过分段读取和覆盖策略优化长文本处理，在32K训练下实现3.5M QA任务性能损失<5%，512K测试中达95%+。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本处理中线性复杂度与性能下降的挑战。

Method: 引入MemAgent工作流，分段读取文本并更新内存，扩展DAPO算法进行多对话生成训练。

Result: 在32K训练下实现3.5M QA任务性能损失<5%，512K测试中达95%+。

Conclusion: MemAgent在长文本任务中表现出色，具备强大的上下文扩展能力。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DoMIX提出了一种基于LoRA模块的新方法，解决了持续领域自适应预训练（DAP）的高计算成本、数据顺序敏感性和单一模型通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续DAP方法存在高计算成本、数据顺序敏感性和单一模型通用性问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用LoRA模块（一种参数高效微调方法），实现高效、并行且对领域顺序鲁棒的DAP，并为特定任务提供定制化预训练模型。

Result: DoMIX不仅解决了持续DAP的挑战，还能扩展到标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX为持续DAP提供了一种高效、灵活且任务定制化的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT是一种混合量子-经典Transformer模型，用参数化量子电路（PQC）替换BERT的FFN模块，减少参数并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN模块在Transformer中占主导参数比例，研究PQC在FFN中的潜力以提升表达能力和训练稳定性。

Method: 设计包含残差连接、RY/RZ旋转和交替纠缠策略的PQC架构，在SST-2和DBpedia基准测试中验证。

Result: QFFN-BERT在完整数据设置中达到基线102%准确率，减少99%参数，并在少样本学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: PQC可作为高效参数替代方案，需结合深度学习原则设计。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

*Weijie Lyu,Sheng-Jun Huang,Xuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于参数化模型的代码数据选择方法，提升训练效率和模型性能，实验显示仅用10K样本即超越92K全样本基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖大量数据但忽视数据质量，导致训练效率低下。

Method: 利用参数化模型选择代码数据，确保分布一致性和多样性。

Result: 仅用10K样本，HumanEval和MBPP分别提升2.4%和2.3%，优于其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升模型性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

### [10] [Benchmarking Akan ASR Models Across Domain-Specific Datasets: A Comparative Evaluation of Performance, Scalability, and Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02407)
*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了七种基于Transformer架构的Akan ASR模型在多样化语音语境中的泛化能力，发现模型性能高度依赖训练领域，并揭示了Whisper和Wav2Vec2在错误行为上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR研究多基于特定领域数据集，缺乏对多样化语音语境泛化能力的评估。

Method: 使用四个Akan语音语料库（涵盖不同领域）对七种ASR模型进行基准测试，比较词错误率和字符错误率。

Result: 模型仅在训练领域表现最优，跨领域时性能显著下降；Whisper和Wav2Vec2在错误行为上存在差异。

Conclusion: 需针对低资源语言开发领域适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Abstract: This study presents an approach for collecting speech samples to build
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for impaired speech, particularly,
low-resource languages. It aims to democratize ASR technology and data
collection by developing a "cookbook" of best practices and training for
community-driven data collection and ASR model building. As a proof-of-concept,
this study curated the first open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan: a
widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable
researchers and practitioners to create inclusive ASR technologies tailored to
the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿，而现有开源模型在极端不确定性下的系统推理能力不足。

Method: 通过结构化采样和信息模糊化生成高不确定性任务，结合RFT冷启动和DUPO强化学习算法。

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，性能接近专有代理。

Conclusion: WebSailor成功缩小了开源模型与专有代理在复杂任务中的能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了高质量标注数据的稀缺问题，提出人类标签变异（HLV）作为信息信号的重要性，并提出了一个结合HLV的主动学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督学习中高质量标注数据的限制问题，并强调人类标签变异（HLV）作为信息信号的价值。

Method: 分解标签变异（LV）为信号（如HLV）和噪声（如标注错误），提出一个结合HLV的主动学习框架，包括实例选择、标注者选择和标签表示。

Result: 提出了一个概念框架，用于在主动学习循环中整合HLV，并讨论了大型语言模型（LLM）作为标注者的应用。

Conclusion: 为HLV感知的主动学习奠定了概念基础，更好地反映了真实世界标注的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF是一种新型的后训练对齐框架，通过多视角生成和分解基线分布来减轻LLM的偏见，无需大量提示工程或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对减轻LLM偏见需求的增加，MPF旨在提供一种可扩展且可解释的对齐方法。

Method: 基于SAGED管道，MPF通过分解基线分布（如HR专业人士的情感分布）为可解释的视角组件，并通过采样和平衡响应来引导生成。

Result: 实验表明，MPF能有效对齐LLM的情感分布，减小KL散度和校准误差，并泛化到未见问题。

Conclusion: MPF为LLM的对齐和偏见减轻提供了一种可扩展且兼容已部署模型的方法。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Motivation: 探究性别与语境偏见的关联，尤其是职业相关偏见，并开发工具量化与解释这些偏见。

Method: 引入GenderLexicon数据集和评估框架，通过评分量化语境偏见及其性别偏见，并在五个多样化数据集上验证。

Result: 模型能有效量化并解释性别偏见，证实了性别偏见不仅限于职业刻板印象。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集为性别偏见研究提供了新工具，证实了性别偏见的广泛存在。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用LLMs辅助同行评审，特别是识别论文局限性的潜力，提出了LimitGen基准，并通过文献检索增强LLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审是科研的核心，但日益增长的论文数量加剧了这一过程的挑战。LLMs在科学任务中表现优异，但其在辅助同行评审（尤其是识别局限性）方面的潜力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了LimitGen基准，包括合成数据集LimitGen-Syn和真实数据集LimitGen-Human，并通过文献检索增强LLMs的能力。

Result: LimitGen基准成功评估了LLMs在识别局限性方面的能力，并通过文献检索提升了其反馈的具体性和建设性。

Conclusion: LLMs在辅助同行评审中具有潜力，LimitGen基准为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类元音模仿的最小可感知差异（JPD），发现其范围在14至51 mels之间，对语音产生理论和元音系统结构有启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类元音模仿的精确控制程度，填补关于听觉空间目标控制机制的知识空白。

Method: 采用元音模仿范式，测量两组英语使用者在F1 X F2空间中的JPD。

Result: JPD估计在14至51 mels之间，为元音系统的最小距离提供了理论下限。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持语音产生的片段理论，并为人类元音系统的可能结构提供了心理物理学解释。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自我纠正方面存在系统性盲点，影响其可靠性和可信度，需深入研究。

Method: 引入Self-Correction Bench框架，通过控制错误注入测试14种模型，分析盲点率。

Result: 平均盲点率为64.5%，发现训练数据组成是主要原因，简单提示可显著改善。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的局限性，提出了提升可靠性的潜在途径。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，具备推理能力的语言模型（RLMs）在对抗社会偏见时可能比基础模型更脆弱，推理机制可能无意中强化刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力对语言模型在偏见和安全性的影响，尤其是推理机制是否提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CLEAR-Bias基准评估RLMs，采用LLM-as-a-judge方法进行自动化安全评分，并利用越狱技术测试安全机制。

Result: 具备推理能力的模型（如CoT提示或微调推理轨迹）比基础模型更容易引发偏见，推理可能无意中增加刻板印象的传播。

Conclusion: 推理能力并不必然提高模型的鲁棒性，需在设计推理机制时更关注偏见问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

TL;DR: 论文提出MathV-DP数据集和Qwen-VL-DP模型，通过多样化解决方案和监督学习提升多模态数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在数学推理中依赖单一解决方案，忽视了多样化的推理视角和内部反思。

Method: 构建MathV-DP数据集，提出Qwen-VL-DP模型，结合监督学习和基于规则的强化学习（GRPO）。

Result: Qwen-VL-DP在MathVista和Math-V基准测试中显著优于现有MLLMs，提高了准确性和生成多样性。

Conclusion: 多样化的推理视角和反思性推理对多模态数学推理至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出SynapseRoute框架，动态分配查询到高成本推理或低成本非推理模式，优化医疗问答的准确性和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在应用中需平衡性能和成本，而推理与非推理模式间的成本差距显著。研究发现58%的医疗问题无需高成本推理即可准确回答。

Method: 提出SynapseRoute，基于机器学习的动态路由框架，根据问题复杂度分配查询到不同模式。

Result: 实验显示SynapseRoute在医疗数据集上提升准确性（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），减少推理时间36.8%和token消耗39.66%。

Conclusion: 动态路由避免对简单问题过度推理，优化性能与成本，并引入AIT指数综合评估准确性、延迟和token成本。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升AI与人类交互的成功率，关键在于语言模型能精确遵循包含输出约束的指令。现有模型在泛化能力上表现不足，亟需改进。

Method: 引入新基准IFBench评估泛化能力，设计约束验证模块，并采用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）训练模型。

Result: RLVR显著提升了模型在精确遵循指令上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过IFBench和RLVR方法，模型在遵循多样化输出约束指令的能力上得到显著提升，为未来研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文描述了一种语言模型（LM）在用户反馈训练中的漏洞，单个用户可通过提供提示和点赞/点踩反馈持续改变模型的知识和行为。攻击者通过操纵反馈信号，使模型在后续偏好调整中更倾向于输出恶意响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示语言模型在用户反馈训练中的潜在安全漏洞，特别是单个用户如何通过有限权限（如点赞/点踩）对模型行为产生持久影响。

Method: 攻击方法包括：1）让模型随机输出“中毒”或良性响应；2）通过点赞中毒响应或点踩良性响应操纵反馈信号；3）在后续偏好调整中，模型更倾向于输出中毒响应。

Result: 结果显示，攻击可用于：1）插入模型原本不具备的事实知识；2）修改代码生成模式以引入安全漏洞；3）注入虚假金融新闻。

Conclusion: 结论指出，该研究不仅揭示了偏好调整的新特性（即有限反馈数据可精细控制模型行为），还扩展了针对用户反馈训练语言模型的攻击机制。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

TL;DR: 论文提出MOTIF方法，通过强化学习微调实现模块化思考，突破LLM的上下文限制，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的上下文大小限制了其推理能力，需要一种模块化思考策略来扩展推理范围。

Method: 采用MOTIF方法，通过强化学习微调生成多轮思考标记，增加有效上下文大小。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中，分别比GRPO方法提升了3.8%和3.3%，且仅需15%的样本。

Conclusion: MOTIF方法有效提升了LLM的推理能力，并展示了样本高效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

Method: 采用生成式评测（答案匹配），利用现代语言模型判断自由回答与参考答案的匹配度，并与人工评分对比。

Result: 答案匹配评测与人工评分一致性高，而多选题评测和LLM评分一致性较差。

Conclusion: 生成式评测（答案匹配）优于多选题评测，建议推广使用。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形摘要在科学传播中至关重要，但目前其设计和应用存在障碍，需要大规模数据集和自动化工具支持。

Method: 构建了SciGA-145k数据集，定义了Intra-GA和Inter-GA推荐任务，并提出了CAR评估指标。

Result: 提供了基线模型和CAR指标，为GA推荐和生成研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k推动了视觉科学传播的发展，并为AI在科学中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [32] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了在少量图像数据下学习鲁棒物体检测器的挑战，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略对合成数据质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业视觉系统中高质量训练数据收集耗时，合成数据成为关键解决方案，但现有方法存在渲染时间长和仿真与现实差距大的问题。

Method: 研究了80种视觉概念，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略。

Result: 当条件线索匹配完整训练分布时，合成数据比仅使用真实数据平均提高34%的mAP，最高可达177%。

Conclusion: 布局条件策略在多样性高时表现更优，为合成数据在物体检测中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT是一种新型的二值化视觉变换器，通过引入差分信息和频率分解技术，显著提升了性能，同时保持了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二值化ViT方法性能下降严重或依赖全精度模块的问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含差分信息的注意力模块，采用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，并改进RPReLU激活函数。

Result: 在多种ViT架构中显著优于现有网络量化方法，图像分类和分割性能优越。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT在保持高效的同时，显著提升了二值化ViT的性能。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少帧图像和3D空间冗余导致的遮挡和远距离场景预测精度不足的问题，同时避免现有方法需要额外数据和计算资源的缺点。

Method: 设计了基于流匹配模型的FMSSM模块生成缺失特征，TPV SSM层和PS3M选择性过滤TPV特征，以及MT方法增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FMOcc通过流匹配和选择性特征过滤，显著提升了少帧3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent作为统一的手术辅助解决方案具有潜力。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域高光谱图像分类中同一类别在不同场景下光谱偏移显著的问题。

Method: 设计了三分支Transformer架构（源分支、目标分支和耦合分支），结合语义标记器和耦合多头交叉注意力机制（CMCA），并引入双向蒸馏损失和自适应强化策略（ARS）。

Result: 在跨时空/场景的航空和卫星数据集上表现优于现有方法，在跨时间树种分类任务中比最先进方法高3%~5%。

Conclusion: BiDA框架显著提升了跨域高光谱图像分类的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.

challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

Motivation: 当前V2A方法忽视了电影语言对艺术表达的重要性，导致在部分可见场景中性能下降。

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法，通过模拟电影语言变化，训练学生模型对齐视频特征与音频-视觉对应关系。

Result: 方法在部分可见性场景中显著提升性能，并在VGGSound数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏方法有效解决了V2A模型在电影语言场景中的局限性，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Result: 在多个少样本分割基准测试中，ViRefSAM表现优于现有方法，实现了对未见类别的准确分割。

Conclusion: ViRefSAM通过结合少量参考图像，显著提升了SAM在遥感图像分割中的性能。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet在变化检测任务中表现出色，双分支设计有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Conclusion: LMPNet为弱监督关键点检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用fMRI信号增强视觉解码的方法，通过跨注意力机制将fMRI信息注入多尺度图像特征，提升了目标检测和实例分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解码大脑信号时过于依赖像素对齐，缺乏细粒度的语义对齐，导致重建结果失真。研究旨在探索大脑视觉感知模式及解码模型对语义对象的处理方式。

Method: 开发了一个实验框架，将fMRI表征作为干预条件，通过跨注意力机制将其注入多尺度图像特征，比较有无fMRI信息的下游任务性能。

Result: 实验表明，引入fMRI信号能显著提升目标检测和实例分割的准确性，证实fMRI包含丰富的多对象语义线索和空间定位信息。

Conclusion: fMRI信号蕴含的语义和空间信息尚未被现有模型充分利用，未来研究可进一步挖掘其潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

TL;DR: MAGIC是一种基于扩散模型的少样本异常生成方法，通过多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，解决了背景破坏、掩模对齐和语义合理性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业质量控制中异常数据稀缺，现有方法无法同时满足背景保持、掩模对齐和语义合理性需求。

Method: MAGIC通过微调Stable Diffusion修复模型，结合高斯提示级扰动和掩模引导的空间噪声注入，增强多样性，并通过上下文感知掩模对齐确保语义合理性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上，MAGIC在下游异常任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC是一种高效的少样本异常生成方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

TL;DR: SynTVA是一个新的数据集和基准，用于评估合成视频在文本到视频检索（TVR）任务中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2V合成的评估指标主要关注视觉质量和时间一致性，缺乏对下游任务（如TVR）性能的洞察。

Method: 基于800个多样化的用户查询，使用先进的T2V模型生成合成视频，并标注视频-文本对的四个语义对齐维度。

Result: SynTVA不仅是一个评估工具，还能通过选择高质量合成样本显著提升TVR性能。

Conclusion: SynTVA为数据集增强和合成视频的实用性评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

TL;DR: InnerControl提出了一种新的训练策略，通过在所有扩散步骤中强制空间一致性，提高了文本到图像生成模型的空间控制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet++）仅关注最终去噪步骤的循环一致性，忽略了中间生成阶段，限制了其效果。

Method: 通过训练轻量级卷积探针，从中间UNet特征重建输入控制信号，并在整个扩散过程中最小化预测与目标条件之间的差异。

Result: InnerControl在多种条件方法（如边缘、深度）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InnerControl通过全局对齐损失提升了控制保真度和生成质量。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻叶病严重影响产量和经济收益，需要早期检测以实现有效管理和提高产量。

Method: 研究采用特征提取算法、降维算法、特征选择算法和极限学习机（ELM）进行实验，并通过10折交叉验证评估分类性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，特征分析检测模型（FADM）在分类水稻叶病方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的FADM模型在改善作物健康、减少产量损失和提高水稻种植的可持续性方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Result: 在两个脑部MRA数据集上验证，该方法在分叉检测任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标志点邻近和视觉相似性导致的漏检问题，并适应了CoW的解剖变异性。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining

32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in

TL;DR: Hita是一种新型图像标记器，通过整体到局部的标记方案和可学习的查询，改进了自回归图像生成模型的全局信息捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归图像生成模型逐步生成视觉标记，限制了捕捉标记序列整体关系的能力；现有视觉标记器将局部图像块映射为潜在标记，导致全局信息有限。

Method: Hita采用整体到局部的标记方案，结合可学习的整体查询和局部块标记，并引入两种策略：1）在序列结构中优先安排整体标记，使用因果注意力；2）在解码前通过轻量融合模块控制信息流。

Result: Hita显著提升了自回归生成器的训练速度，并在ImageNet基准测试中取得2.59 FID和281.9 IS的优异表现。

Conclusion: Hita不仅提升了图像生成质量，还能有效捕捉全局图像属性，并在零样本风格迁移和图像修复中表现出色。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中复杂且高度动态的运动使得从多视角输入合成任意视角的动态视频具有挑战性，现有方法难以同时处理大尺度和小尺度运动。

Method: 1) 将动态场景分解为由种子定义的局部空间，实现全局建模；2) 解耦静态与动态特征，静态特征捕捉静态信息，动态残差场提供时间特异性特征，生成时间高斯模型。

Result: 在多种小尺度数据集上表现优异，并首次尝试建模更大更复杂的高度动态场景。

Conclusion: LocalDyGS为高度动态场景的建模提供了更现实的解决方案，扩展了现有方法的适用范围。

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

Result: 实验表明该方法具有高准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MIL在持续任务中的适应性问题，尤其是针对大规模图像（如WSI）的实例分类和定位任务。

Method: 结合GDAT（高效实例编码）、BPPL（可靠伪标记）和OWLoRA（遗忘缓解）技术。

Result: 在三个公开WSI数据集上，CoMEL在持续MIL任务中表现优异，分类和定位准确率分别提升11.00%和23.4%。

Conclusion: CoMEL为MIL在持续任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能并减少了遗忘。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

Motivation: 传统检测器仅通过堆叠空间频率谱来表征时间信息，无法检测像素平面的时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素的时间轴进行1D傅里叶变换，提取对时间不一致性敏感的特征，并结合注意力模块和联合变换模块。

Result: 显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的鲁棒性，适用于多样化检测场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测深度伪造视频方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高。涂鸦标注作为一种稀疏标注方式，虽然高效，但特征学习和边界监督不足，限制了分割网络的训练效果。

Method: TAB Net包含三重增强自恢复（TAS）模块和边界感知伪标签监督（BAP）模块。TAS通过强度变换、局部遮挡和拼图增强提升特征学习；BAP通过融合双分支预测和边界感知损失优化伪标签和边界建模。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg数据集上，TAB Net显著优于现有弱监督方法，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net为稀疏标注下的医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案，性能优越且接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Conclusion: 结合扩散模型和自动编码器的方法能够有效学习图像表示并修复图像伪影，为图像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Method: 引入两阶段调优框架，优化超参数以提升跟踪性能，避免依赖复杂的重识别或运动模型。

Result: 在PBVS Thermal MOT数据集上验证了方法的有效性，适用于多种热成像条件。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际监控应用提供了鲁棒的行人跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Conclusion: PFIP是一种高效且隐私保护的密文域人脸检索方案，适用于大规模模板库。

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Motivation: 当前3D高斯编辑方法无法满足虚拟角色化妆的基本需求，如动态表情下的外观一致性、身份保持和精细控制。

Method: 采用从粗到细的策略，利用扩散模型生成化妆图像作为监督，提出Coherent Duplication方法确保多视角和动态表情的一致性，并通过Refinement Module提升化妆质量。

Result: 实验表明，AvatarMakeup在化妆转移质量和动画一致性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup通过扩散模型和优化策略，实现了高质量的3D虚拟角色化妆，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自由形式的测试时间适应（F²TTA）任务，并开发了图像级解耦提示调优（I-DiPT）框架，以应对临床实践中数据以片段形式随机到达的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，测试时间适应（TTA）成为适应未见医疗站点数据的有效方法。然而，现有方法假设数据以完整域单位到达，而临床实践中数据通常以片段形式随机到达，导致适应过程可能被干扰。

Method: 提出I-DiPT框架，包含图像不变提示和图像特定提示，分别用于探索域不变表示和适应每个测试图像。通过不确定性导向掩码（UoM）和并行图蒸馏（PGD）解决知识表示不足问题。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类任务上的实验表明，该方法优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: I-DiPT框架有效解决了自由形式测试数据适应问题，为临床实践提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at
https://github.com/mar-cry/F2TTA.

Result: MobileNet v1表现最佳，成功率达98%，推理速度达6611 FPS。

Conclusion: FPGA可加速ANN，适用于注意力机制，提升机器人实时检测能力。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

Result: 在DramaAD数据集上，HIVE框架在通用和广告编辑任务中均优于现有基线，显著缩小了自动与人工编辑视频的质量差距。

Conclusion: HIVE框架通过多模态叙事理解提升了自动视频编辑的连贯性和质量，为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖配对数据集且可能导致过增强，IGDNet旨在解决这些问题。

Method: IGDNet通过分解模块和去噪模块分离图像成分并增强光照，利用下采样生成噪声对迭代优化结果。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，IGDNet在PSNR（20.41dB）和SSIM（0.860dB）上表现优异。

Conclusion: IGDNet在复杂光照条件下显著提升视觉质量，且无需训练数据。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: WeCoL方案有效减少标注需求，性能接近全监督方法，为红外小目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性得分达4.78，攻击成功率达85%，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击有效揭示了MLLMs的安全漏洞，为未来防御研究提供了方向。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集填补了现有研究的空白，推动了复杂场景下多行人跟踪算法的发展。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，碎片化率降低了2.2倍。

Conclusion: 时间感知对息肉计数至关重要，新方法达到了最新技术水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，MC-INR在科学数据编码任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR通过创新设计有效解决了现有INR方法的局限性，为复杂科学数据的编码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to

TL;DR: MoGe-2是一种先进的开放域几何估计模型，通过单张图像恢复场景的度量尺度3D点图。它在MoGe基础上改进，实现了度量几何预测，并通过数据细化方法提升了细节恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoGe）只能预测未知尺度的仿射不变点图，无法同时实现度量尺度和细节恢复。MoGe-2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 扩展MoGe以实现度量几何预测，开发统一数据细化方法，利用合成标签过滤和补全真实数据。

Result: 模型在混合数据集上训练，评估显示其在相对几何精度、度量尺度和细节恢复方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoGe-2首次同时实现了准确的相对几何、精确的度量尺度和细粒度细节恢复。

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉模糊和遮挡情况下难以恢复合理的交互动作，即使是大型基础模型也无法准确区分人类语义。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并构建了带有伪真实标注的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从复杂环境中准确估计交互动作，为未来研究提供了新思路和数据支持。

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Motivation: 现有血管表示方法（体素、网格、参数化模型）通常独立使用，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 通过可微分体素化和形状到分割的拟合，自动提取血管参数化模型（中心线和半径），并使用三次B样条确保平滑性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确捕捉复杂血管几何形状，如主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管。

Conclusion: 该框架成功统一了三种表示方法，并能生成高保真网格。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Motivation: 现有3D医学图像自监督学习方法忽略了结构变化，无法有效捕捉解剖学差异。

Result: 在10个数据集、4个任务和3种模态上的实验表明，$S^2DC$优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $S^2DC$通过学习结构感知表示，显著提升了3D医学图像自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

Result: AuroraLong在多个视频基准测试中表现接近Transformer模型，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 线性RNN有望降低长视频理解的计算门槛，推动其普及。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Conclusion: Holmes-Set和Holmes Pipeline有效提升了AI生成图像检测的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Conclusion: 新框架成功结合了扩散模型的优势，提升了后验采样的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Conclusion: APT为有限数据下的扩散模型个性化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap是一个视频人脸交换框架，通过解耦面部外观和运动信息，实现高质量身份转移并保留目标脸部的动态属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在身份转移时难以保持目标脸部的动态属性（如表情、姿态等），导致结果不一致。

Method: 提出CanonSwap框架，先消除运动信息在统一规范空间修改身份，再整合回原视频空间；设计了Partial Identity Modulation模块和细粒度同步评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，CanonSwap在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap通过解耦运动与外观信息，有效解决了视频人脸交换中的动态属性保留问题。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

TL;DR: SIU3R提出了一种无需对齐的框架，通过像素对齐的3D表示统一理解和重建任务，实现了原生3D理解，并通过轻量级模块促进任务协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D到3D特征对齐，导致3D理解能力有限和语义信息丢失，SIU3R旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SIU3R通过像素对齐的3D表示桥接重建和理解任务，统一多个理解任务为可学习查询，并设计轻量级模块促进任务协作。

Result: 实验表明SIU3R在3D重建、理解及同时任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SIU3R的无对齐框架和任务协作设计有效提升了3D理解和重建的性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DiT的框架UniMC，用于统一控制多类图像生成，并发布了大规模数据集HAIG-2.9M，解决了现有关键点引导模型在非刚性物体和多重叠对象生成中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关键点引导模型在生成非刚性物体（如动物）和多重叠对象时存在局限性，主要由于方法固有缺陷和缺乏合适数据集。

Method: 设计了UniMC框架，将实例和关键点条件整合为紧凑令牌，并提出HAIG-2.9M数据集，包含丰富注释和严格人工检查。

Result: 实验证明HAIG-2.9M数据集的高质量和UniMC的有效性，尤其在遮挡和多类场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: UniMC和HAIG-2.9M为关键点引导的图像生成提供了新解决方案，显著提升了多类和非刚性物体生成的性能。

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

TL;DR: FairHuman提出了一种多目标微调方法，通过全局和局部学习目标提升人像生成的细节质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在生成人像时，局部细节（如面部和手部）质量不足，缺乏训练监督。

Method: 构建全局和局部学习目标，基于MPD准则优化参数更新策略，实现公平的多目标优化。

Result: 显著提升了局部细节生成质量，同时保持整体生成效果。

Conclusion: FairHuman在不同场景下均能有效提升人像生成性能。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Result: 在有限数据设置下，平均Dice分数达84.90%，优于全监督和弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合基础模型和弱监督分割，显著减少注释成本并提升性能。

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，DexVLG实现了76%的零样本执行成功率和最先进的部件抓取精度。

Conclusion: DexVLG展示了强大的零样本泛化能力，适用于真实场景的部件对齐抓取。

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次复杂度限制了其在高分辨率输入中的应用，现有方法常以牺牲细节为代价。

Method: 受n体数值模拟启发，将注意力建模为网格点间的交互问题，提出多极注意力神经算子（MANO），实现多尺度距离计算。

Result: 在图像分类和Darcy流任务中，MANO性能与ViT和Swin Transformer相当，但运行时间和内存消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: MANO通过线性复杂度实现了高效且高性能的注意力计算，为高分辨率输入处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Motivation: 解决定向目标检测中高标注成本的问题，提出更高效的弱监督方法。

Method: 提出PWOOD框架、OS-Student模型和CPF策略，利用部分弱标注（水平框或单点）提升性能。

Result: 在DOTA和DIOR数据集上表现优于传统半监督算法。

Conclusion: PWOOD框架为定向目标检测提供了一种低成本、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Conclusion: 通过语义分割和新的评分系统，该研究提升了地震后损坏评估的客观性和准确性，有助于更有效的灾害响应。

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Conclusion: 该框架在无需训练的情况下，实现了结构丰富且外观丰富的图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过利用语义先验和参考图像，该方法实现了高效的对象分割，为下游任务提供了自动化的分割掩码生成方案。

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在静态面部表现优秀，但在可动画化虚拟形象中仍存在非线性变形和细节不足的问题，需要更高效的表示方法。

Result: 在4个面部数据集上的19个受试者中，HyperGaussians在数值和视觉上均优于3D高斯泼溅，尤其在高频细节和复杂动作上表现突出。

Conclusion: HyperGaussians为高质量可动画化面部虚拟形象提供了一种高效且表现力强的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Conclusion: LangScene-X通过生成一致的新观察，实现了从稀疏视图构建可泛化的3D语言嵌入场景。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR框架有效解决了多模态HAR系统的关键问题。

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态特征组合（文本、图像和社交特征）在社交媒体虚假信息检测中的有效性，结果表明多模态模型比单模态或双模态模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体在选举和危机期间充斥大量虚假信息，但现有研究多集中于文本或图像单模态检测，缺乏对多模态特征组合的探索。

Method: 采用早期融合方法，结合文本、图像和社交特征构建分类模型，并利用无监督和有监督机器学习模型分析1,529条推文。

Result: 多模态模型分类性能比单模态模型提升15%，比双模态模型提升5%，并分析了虚假信息的传播模式。

Conclusion: 多模态特征组合能显著提升虚假信息检测效果，且社交和视觉特征对识别传播模式有重要作用。

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: 研究发现，专有领域模型Match Score在招聘中比通用LLM更准确和公平，强调领域特定建模和偏见审核的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在招聘中的潜在偏见和准确性不足问题，并提出专有模型解决方案。

Method: 比较多个LLM与专有模型Match Score在10,000个真实招聘数据上的准确性和公平性。

Result: Match Score在ROC AUC（0.85 vs 0.77）和公平性（种族影响比0.957 vs 0.809）上优于LLM。

Conclusion: 专有模型能同时实现高准确性和公平性，强调在招聘等高风险领域需谨慎使用通用LLM。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统2思维方法存在模态或问题特异性，且需要额外监督。本文探索是否可以通过无监督学习实现通用系统2思维。

Method: 训练基于能量的Transformer（EBTs），通过能量最小化优化输入与候选预测的兼容性。

Result: EBTs在训练和推理中表现优于Transformer++和Diffusion Transformers，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: EBTs是一种有前景的新范式，可同时提升模型的学习和思维能力。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线部署中草稿模型与目标模型不兼容以及延迟改进的需求，提出“一个草稿模型适配所有”的范式。

Method: 引入在线n-gram缓存和混合蒸馏微调，解决跨词汇不匹配问题，并采用自适应起草技术提升解码速度。

Result: OmniDraft使单个Llama-68M模型能与多种目标模型配合使用，并在数学推理、编码和文本生成任务中提供1.5-2倍加速。

Conclusion: OmniDraft适用于设备端LLM应用，解决了模型成本、效率和用户定制化的核心问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的后训练方法依赖模型初始能力生成正样本，难以解决初始失败的问题，尤其是在早期训练和复杂推理任务中。

Method: 提出Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)，通过结合当前策略和正确答案生成高质量样本，以引导模型探索新的推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，ExPO在推理基准测试中提升了学习效率和最终性能，尤其在MATH level-5等挑战性任务中优于基于专家示范的方法。

Conclusion: ExPO通过生成更符合策略的高质量样本，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型组织和初创公司缺乏法律专业知识，手动提取法律文本的元数据以生成合规需求既耗时又复杂。现有自动化方法未能充分考虑元数据属性间的关联，且依赖手动标注或启发式机器学习，泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用文本蕴含和上下文学习技术，设计了一个领域特定的Python类结构作为元模型，自动生成法律文本的规范表示，减少对手动标注数据的依赖。

Result: 在13个美国州的数据泄露通知法律上测试，生成的表示通过了89.4%的测试用例，精确率和召回率分别为82.2和88.7。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动生成可执行的法律文本表示，显著提高了法律合规性分析的效率和泛化能力，适用于未见过的法律文本。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Motivation: 需求访谈中，访谈者面临领域不熟悉、认知负荷和信息过载等挑战，需要实时生成合适的问题。

Result: LLM生成的问题在无指导和指导条件下均不劣于人类问题，且在指导后表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实时提升需求访谈的质量和效率。

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

TL;DR: 评估前沿大语言模型（LLM）的隐写能力，发现当前模型在标准条件下难以隐藏短消息，但在额外条件下可能成功。初步迹象显示模型能进行基本编码推理，但尚无法有效欺骗监控。

Motivation: 研究LLM的隐写能力以评估其潜在风险，尤其是如何通过隐藏信息或推理逃避监控。

Method: 评估两种隐写方式：隐藏编码消息和进行编码推理，测试模型在不同条件下的表现。

Result: 当前模型在标准条件下无法隐藏短消息，但在额外条件下可能成功；初步显示模型能进行基本编码推理，但难以欺骗监控。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的隐写能力尚不成熟，但未来可能发展出更强的逃避监控能力。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LALM方法在增强LLM音频能力时会导致语言能力遗忘，因此需要一种既能保留LLM语言能力又能实现音频-文本对齐的新方法。

Method: 提出DeSTA策略，通过LLM自生成训练目标，构建任务无关的大规模数据集DeSTA-AQA5M（500万样本，7000小时音频）。

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio在多个音频-语言基准测试中达到或超越现有最佳性能，证明了自生成策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的数据构建策略对开发通用LALM至关重要，DeSTA为构建鲁棒的音频语言模型提供了实用方法。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

Conclusion: FinAI-BERT为金融NLP提供了细粒度分类方案，为分析师、监管者和学者提供了可扩展且透明的工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

Motivation: 推荐系统中的不公平问题（如性别、种族、年龄或流行度偏见）会随时间加剧，导致马太效应、过滤气泡和回音室等问题。

Method: HyFairCRS通过对比学习建立多样化的超图捕捉用户兴趣，并在对话中利用这些兴趣生成公平的推荐。

Result: 在两个CRS数据集上的实验表明，HyFairCRS在性能上达到新高度，并有效缓解不公平问题。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS为动态对话推荐系统提供了一种有效的公平性解决方案。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

Conclusion: STELLA为动态学习和扩展的AI系统提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical

Conclusion: LLMs具备战略智能，为经典博弈论与机器心理学提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）和基于推理的方法在处理复杂信息需求时效率低下，因为它们使用单一模型同时处理高级规划和详细执行。

Method: HiRA将复杂任务分解为子任务，分配给具备外部工具和推理能力的领域特定代理，并通过结构化机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个跨模态深度搜索基准测试中，HiRA显著优于现有RAG和基于代理的系统，提高了答案质量和系统效率。

Conclusion: 分离规划和执行对于多步信息搜索任务非常有效，HiRA展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: StepHint是一种新型RLVR算法，通过多级逐步提示帮助模型更有效地探索解空间，解决了近失奖励问题和探索停滞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在近失奖励问题和探索停滞问题，限制了训练效率和模型能力提升。

Method: StepHint利用强模型生成有效推理链，并通过自适应分割方法将其划分为推理步骤，提供多级提示引导模型探索。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于竞争方法，并在域外基准测试中表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: StepHint通过多级提示显著提升了RLVR的训练效率和模型推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了自动说话人验证（ASV）嵌入在捕捉语音身份时的局限性，发现其主要关注静态特征（如音色和音高范围），而忽略了动态特征（如节奏）。作者提出了U3D指标来评估动态节奏模式，并公开了代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音身份建模具有多面性，而现有的ASV嵌入设计用于区分而非表征身份。本文旨在探究这些嵌入捕捉了语音的哪些方面。

Method: 通过分析广泛使用的ASV嵌入，识别其局限性，并提出U3D指标以评估动态节奏模式。

Result: 发现ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，忽略动态元素，并提出了缓解测量混淆的策略。

Conclusion: U3D指标填补了现有方法的不足，为语音克隆系统中说话人身份一致性的评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的注意力机制会分配部分权重给无关信息，可能损害模型的判别能力。

Method: 引入差分注意力机制，结合双softmax操作和调优的差分系数，优化注意力分配。

Result: ASDA在音频分类（AS-2M 49.0% mAP，AS20K 41.5% mAP）、关键词识别（SPC-2 98.3%准确率）和环境声音分类（ESC-50 96.1%准确率）中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: ASDA有效提升了音频任务的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在资源有限的移动设备上部署大型语言模型（LLM）的能效问题，提出了一种统一的能量感知调度器FUSE，显著优化了LLM推理的能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动设备上的LLM框架因CPU、GPU和内存调度器独立运行导致能效低下，亟需一种统一的调度方案。

Method: 通过测量现有LLM框架的能效问题，设计并实现了FUSE，一个统一能量感知调度器。

Result: FUSE在相同能耗下，显著降低了首次令牌和每输出令牌的延迟。

Conclusion: FUSE有效提升了移动设备上LLM推理的能效，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.
