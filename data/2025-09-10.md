*Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Alessandro Angioi,Michelangelo Puliga,Davide Sanna,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedBench-IT是首个针对意大利医学大学入学考试的全面基准测试，包含17,410道专家编写的选择题，涵盖6个学科和3个难度级别，用于评估LLM在意大利语医学教育领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在教育领域的应用潜力日益增长，但针对非英语语言在专业领域的基准测试仍然稀缺，特别是意大利语医学教育领域缺乏标准化的评估工具。

Method: 从领先的备考材料出版商Edizioni Simone收集数据，构建包含6个学科的多选题数据集。评估了包括GPT-4o、Claude系列等专有模型和参数小于30B的开源模型，进行了准确性、可重复性测试、排序偏差分析和推理提示评估。

Result: 模型在测试中表现出88.86%的回答一致性（因学科而异），排序偏差影响最小，发现题目可读性与模型性能之间存在统计显著但较小的负相关关系。

Conclusion: MedBench-IT为意大利NLP社区、教育技术开发者和从业者提供了重要资源，揭示了当前LLM在该关键领域的能力，并提供了标准化的评估方法学。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

### [3] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型自动评估动态发展主题模型的框架，通过9个评测指标覆盛四个关键质量维度，提供更可解释和健壮的评估结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动化评测指标如相关性和多样性只能抓取统计模式，无法发现语义失败，需要更好的主题模型评估方法

Method: 设计了一个面向目标的评估框架，使用9个LLM基于的评测指标，涵盖词法有效性、主题内语义健壮性、主题间结构健壮性和文档-主题对齐健壮性四个关键质量维度

Result: LLM基于的评测指标提供了可解释、健壮且与任务相关的评估，能够发现传统指标忽略的关键缺陷如重复性和语义偏移

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展、细粒度的评估工具，以维持动态数据集中主题的相关性

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting
this work are accessible at

TL;DR: EnergyGPT是基于LLaMA 3.1-8B微调的专业能源领域语言模型，在能源相关任务上表现优于基础模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在需要深度技术专业知识的能源等专业领域效果有限，需要领域专业化的模型

Method: 通过监督微调LLaMA 3.1-8B模型，使用高质量能源领域文本语料库，包括数据收集整理、模型微调、基准设计和评估的完整开发流程

Result: EnergyGPT在大多数能源相关语言理解和生成任务上优于基础模型，证明了训练策略能在不需要大规模基础设施的情况下提升领域相关性和性能

Conclusion: 领域专业化微调是提升大语言模型在专业领域表现的有效方法，EnergyGPT为能源领域提供了专门的AI解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [5] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DischargeSim是一个评估大语言模型在出院沟通中作为个性化教育者能力的新基准，通过模拟医患对话来测试模型在六个临床主题的表现，发现不同模型在出院教育能力上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 出院沟通是患者护理中关键但未被充分研究的环节，现有的大语言模型基准主要关注诊断推理，而忽略了模型在就诊后支持患者的能力评估。

Method: DischargeSim通过模拟LLM驱动的DoctorAgents与具有不同心理社会特征的PatientAgents之间的多轮对话，在六个临床主题上进行评估，包括对话质量、个性化文档生成和患者理解度三个维度。

Result: 对18个大语言模型的实验显示，在出院教育能力方面存在显著差距，模型性能因患者特征而异，模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果。

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估大语言模型在就诊后临床教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [6] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于道德原则的框架，通过规则引擎处理LLM不确定性，提供透明的语言理由和行动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率方法不透明且与透明性期望不一致，需要在高风险场景中解释LLM的不确定性

Method: 采用道德心理学和美德伦理学的规则（如预防、尊重、责任），在Prolog引擎中编码，根据不确定性级别触发对应行动

Result: 通过场景模拟测试规则覆盖率、公平性和信任检验，临床和法律应用案例证明可提高信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任致的自然语言生成提供了透明、轻量级的概率模型替代方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [7] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动标注德国议会辩论中的(反)团结子类型，评估模型性能并分析二战后至今德国对移民的团结趋势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法限制了大规模政治文本分析的深度和范围，需要自动化工具来研究德国长期移民辩论中的(反)团结表达模式

Method: 评估多种大型语言模型在标注德国议会辩论(反)团结子类型任务上的表现，包括模型规模、提示工程、微调等因素的影响，并与数千个人工标注进行对比

Result: 模型在复杂标注任务上表现良好，数据揭示战后时期高度移民导向的团结，以及2015年以来德国议会中强烈的反团结趋势

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在政治文本分析中具有巨大潜力，德国移民辩论的重要性凸显，人口下降和劳动力短缺与日益加剧的两极分化并存

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

### [8] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新颖的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的key来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模基准测试中优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只编码前文信息，限制了模型获取完整上下文的能力。

Method: 引入CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的keys（称为lookahead keys），使其能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性。通过数学等价性实现高效并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同模型规模下均优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新keys来整合后续信息，在保持自回归特性的同时显著提升了语言建模性能，为注意力机制提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

### [9] [Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07308)
*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BVM方法在图像状态分类中表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面不如逻辑回归模型，但存在改进空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试BVM方法在判断图像状态变化方面的能力，特别是在名词状态分类和形容词区分方面的表现

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词），通过语言嵌入来评估状态变化。第一实验比较BVM与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化等指标的名词状态分类能力；第二实验比较BVM与逻辑回归模型的形容词区分能力

Result: BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳，优于其他对比指标；但在形容词区分方面，没有发现BVM明显优于逻辑回归模型的证据

Conclusion: BVM方法在名词状态分类方面有效，但在形容词区分方面需要进一步改进方法以提高准确性

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

*Chi-Yang Hsu,Alexander Braylan,Yiheng Su,Omar Alonso,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的长文本生成任务表现预测测试框架，能够通过黑盒模型的输入输出预测多维度评价指标的连续分数，包括不确定性预测区间。在11个任务上验证，仅需16个训练示例即可得到有效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为长文本生成任务建立一个可以预测多维度、细粒度质量指标的表现预测测试框架，解决黑盒模型性能评估的挑战。

Method: 任务、模型和指标无关的黑盒方式，仅根据模型输入输出预测连续的评价指标分数，并推断预测区间来量化不确定性。

Result: 在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，包括多个大语言模型、基线方法和多种指标。结果显示仅需16个训练示例即可在长文本生成任务上有效预测指标分数。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个新题和有用的任务，为推动进步提供了价值较高的测试框架，并提供了可以立即实际应用的基线方法。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [11] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来评估数据熟悉度，选择不熟悉的数据进行训练以提升泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT训练中数据选择方法依赖提示工程、成本高且适用范围有限的问题

Method: 通过计算模型各层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据熟悉度，使用简单分类器架构选择不熟悉的数据

Result: 实验表明使用不熟悉数据训练能获得更好的泛化性能，且方法适用于多种任务类型

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效且通用的数据选择方法，无需复杂提示工程，能显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SAOBP框架，通过信念传播注入多跳关系来解决Transformer自注意力机制中的局部化问题，防止注意力熵崩溃并改善模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力容易集中在有限token子集上，难以捕获长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)来量化和解释多跳连接的相对贡献

Result: SAOBP能够防止深层网络中的注意力熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，在小规模模型中表现出竞争性性能提升

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了注意力局部化问题，特别适合资源受限场景下的推理质量提升，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse是一个基于大五人格模型和特质激活理论的LLM后训练框架，通过混合专家架构使模型能够根据不同情境自适应表达不同人格特质，显著提升社交情感智能而不损害通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在真实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同的社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达，这限制了它们在社交陪伴和心理支持等人类中心应用中的效果。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和大五人格模型，采用混合专家架构（Mixture-of-Expert），结合人格适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化的特质表达。

Result: PersonaFuse在社交情感智能的多个维度上显著优于基线模型，在下游应用如心理健康咨询和客户服务中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示其响应质量与GPT-4o和DeepSeek等领先模型相当。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的大语言模型，标志着向更人性化AI系统的重要进展，且不牺牲模型安全性或通用推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

*Sankalp Tattwadarshi Swain,Anshika Krishnatray,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在通过交互反馈学习新语言方面失败，无法在100次回复内建立对话，但展现了类似人类的语言学习策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语言模型的词汇、语法等方面能力，但缺乏对通过交互反馈学习语言的评估，这是人类语言获取的核心特征。

Method: 提出了一种新的实验框架，让LLM模型与只理解新构建语言Tinkatongue的机器人进行对话，评估其通过模式识别和交互反馈学习语言的能力。

Result: LLM模型在100次回复内无法成功建立对话，但它们采用了与人类语言学习相似的策略，包括模仿、试错等方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为语言模型评估标准提供了新方向，并为设计能够更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开启了新途径。

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Method: 提出LongEmotion基准测试，包含情感分类、检测、问答、对话、摘要和表达6个任务；开发了基于对话上下文和LLM自身的RAG方法，以及五阶段分解的CoEM协作情感建模方法。

Result: 实验结果表明RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中都能持续提升情感智能相关性能，推动LLMs向更实用的现实世界情感应用发展。

Conclusion: LongEmotion基准测试填补了长上下文情感智能评估的空白，提出的RAG和CoEM方法有效提升了LLMs在现实场景中的情感理解能力，为实际应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中积极支持性语言（糖果语音）对培养文明交流有重要作用，但其自动化检测研究不足，限制了系统性影响分析

Method: 使用单语和多语言语言模型（GBERT、Qwen3 Embedding、XLM-RoBERTa）在46k条德语YouTube评论语料上进行糖果语音检测，采用span级训练方法

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Motivation: 污名化语言导致医疗保健不平等，但目前缺乏普遍接受的标准词典来定义医疗保健中的污名化词汇、术语或短语。

Method: 通过系统文献检索识别现有污名化语言词典，进行对比分析：1）词典间的相似性和差异；2）基于已建立情感数据集的正面、负面或中性术语分布。

Result: 识别出4个词典，分析显示它们具有中等语义相似性，大多数污名化术语与临床医生描述感知负面行为的评判性表达相关，情感分析显示主要为负面分类词汇但各词典存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了标准化词典的必要性，并突出了在临床文本中定义污名化语言所面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Conclusion: HALT-RAG提供了一个灵活可靠的工具，通过平衡模型性能和安全要求来解决RAG管道中的幻觉问题

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Motivation: 解决科学领域实体识别任务中LLM微调成本高昂的问题，寻求性能与成本的最佳权衡。

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架，依次采用三种不同的主动学习策略选择最具信息量和代表性的样本，构建真实检索语料库用于LLM上下文学习。

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上，ALLabel在相同标注预算下始终优于所有基线方法，仅标注5%-10%的数据就能达到全数据集标注的相当性能。

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效且具有通用性，能够显著降低LLM实体识别任务的标注成本，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Result: 在不可信场景下平均步骤成功率比最先进方法提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展示了合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过迭代检索和引导分解成功解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为参数不变的知识更新提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等主流生物医学LM上实施该方法后，在一系列语言理解任务中表现提升，实体表示质量改善，即使在小规模PubMed摘要数据集上进行最小预训练也有效。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Motivation: 临床报告通常长繁且充满专业术语，导致医生和患者沟通困难。需要一种有效方法来摘取重要信息，支持共同决策过程。

Method: 使用迭代自我提示(ISP)技术，让LLM生成任务特定提示并通过少样本学习精炼。使用ROUGE和BERT-score指标指导模型微调，在GPT-4和GPT-4o上实现视角感知ISP(PA-ISP)。

Result: 在3,396份多专业临床案例报告上，获得ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERTscore(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)。高BERTscore表明生成了语义等价的摘要，尽管词汇重叠率较低。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP(PA-ISP)技术可以有效应用于临床报告摘要，产生语义等价的摘要内容，支持更好的医患沟通。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

TL;DR: MoLoRAG是一个逻辑感知的多模态多页文档检索框架，通过构建页面图来捕捉页面间的逻辑关系，结合语义和逻辑相关性进行更准确的检索，在四个DocQA数据集上平均准确率提升9.68%。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法将文档转为文本处理会丢失多模态信息（如图表），而大型视觉语言模型受限于输入长度无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接关系。

Method: 构建页面图捕捉页面间的上下文关系，使用轻量级VLM进行图遍历检索相关页面（包括逻辑相关的页面）。提供两种变体：无需训练的解决方案和微调版本以改进逻辑相关性检查。检索后将top-K页面输入任意LVLM进行问答。

Result: 在四个DocQA数据集上实验显示：相比LVLM直接推理平均准确率提升9.68%，相比基线方法检索精度提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过结合语义和逻辑相关性，有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的检索问题，显著提升了文档问答的性能。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了关系抽取训练数据自动提取的问题，结合了多分类和二元分类的优势，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医学等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键问题。现有评测标准过于关注检测质量的权衡，而忽视了低熵学情况下的事实风险。

Method: 提出了一种专门针对医学领域的评估流程，结合使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了事实性权重评分（FWS）综合指标，优先考虑事实准确性而非只是连贯性。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前的水印方法在医学领域存在显著的事实性问题，熵学偏移导致医学实体表达的退化。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了开发领域感知水印方法的必要性，以确保医学内容的完整性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Motivation: 在线平台上虚假新闻、极化内容和有害信息的传播已成为严重问题，但缺乏对不同大语言模型、使用方法和语言性能的系统性基准测试。

Method: 使用10个数据集和5种语言（英语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、阿拉伯语和保加利亚语），测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略（零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习、确定性点过程选择示例和思维链）。

Result: 上下文学习通常表现不如模型微调，即使是较小的微调模型也优于大型模型的上下文学习设置（包括LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct、Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在特定任务设置中对模型进行微调的重要性，即使与大型模型的上下文学习方法相比，微调较小的模型也能获得更好的性能。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Motivation: 解决现有数据集局限于特定论文段落标注的问题，提供完整的全文标注数据以支持更全面的科学文献信息抽取研究。

Method: 构建包含60篇NLP领域全文标注的数据集，进行对比实验验证有效性，并使用该数据集训练模型自动构建NLP领域知识图谱。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在不同长度学术文本上表现各异，SciNLP在某些基线模型上实现显著性能提升，构建的知识图谱平均节点度为3.2，语义拓扑信息丰富。

Conclusion: SciNLP填补了NLP领域全文实体关系抽取数据集的空白，为下游应用提供了高质量的标注数据和知识图谱资源。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DK2R是一个新颖的双知识增强两阶段推理器，利用LLMs处理多模态任务导向对话系统，通过动态选择结构化属性和非结构化评论知识来提升文本响应生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型(LLMs)。作者旨在充分利用双重知识（结构化属性和非结构化评论知识）与LLMs来促进多模态任务导向对话系统中的文本响应生成。

Method: 提出DK2R方法：1）从外部知识库提取结构化和非结构化知识；2）使用LLM评估每种知识类型的效用；3）通过专门推理分别总结意图导向的关键线索；4）将这些线索作为辅助信号增强基于LLM的文本响应生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性。

Conclusion: DK2R通过有效利用双重知识和LLMs，成功解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦两个关键挑战，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成性能。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

*Mihai Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TF2框架，用于英罗文学翻译的数据集创建、微调和评估，包括12B参数的开源模型和合成数据集，在保持竞争力的同时更具成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开源模型在文学翻译中的挑战，为低资源语言（如罗马尼亚语）提供高质量的文学数据集和翻译解决方案。

Method: 使用两阶段微调：指令调优捕捉体裁特定叙事风格，适配器压缩实现高效部署；结合BLEU和五维LLM评估标准。

Result: 微调模型在流畅性和准确性方面与顶级专有模型竞争，同时更加开放、可访问且成本效益显著。

Conclusion: TF2提供了端到端的可复现流程，支持成本效益翻译研究、跨语言叙事生成和在低资源环境中广泛采用开源模型处理文化重要文学内容。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了人类标注者和大型语言模型对提示词修改的敏感性，发现两者都对标签集和标签格式的变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类标注者是否与LLM一样对指令变化敏感，以探讨LLM的提示词脆弱性是否反映了人类标注的固有方差。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对人类和LLM使用相同的指令变体进行实验，比较两者对提示词修改的反应。

Result: 人类和LLM都对标签集和标签格式的变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性低于LLM。

Conclusion: 提示词脆弱性在一定程度上反映了人类标注的方差，但LLM在某些类型的提示词修改上表现出比人类更高的敏感性。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Result: 在偏见检测、分类和缓解方面表现出有效性，最终获得47.90%的平均得分，在共享任务中排名第四。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在中文性别偏见处理任务中取得了良好效果，证明了基于LLM微调和多策略集成的有效性，为自然语言生成的公平性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Motivation: 随着父母越来越多地使用大语言模型生成睡前故事，这些叙事中存在的文化和性别刻板印象问题亟待解决，以确保AI创作的公平性和多样性

Method: 创建Biased Tales综合数据集，分析偏见如何影响LLM生成故事中主角属性和故事元素，比较不同性别和文化背景主角的故事特征

Result: 发现显著差异：女性主角外貌相关属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事 disproportionately 强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题，远超西方儿童故事

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了社会文化偏见在使创意AI使用更加公平和多样化方面的重要作用，需要关注和解决LLM生成内容中的刻板印象问题

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level

leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以有效训练并行思维能力

Method: 提出首个强化学习框架Parallel-R1，采用渐进式课程：先在简单任务上用SFT训练并行思维，然后在困难任务上转为RL进行探索和泛化

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准上实现8.4%准确率提升，分析显示模型早期使用并行思维进行探索，后期用于多视角验证

Conclusion: 并行思维可作为中期探索支架，临时探索阶段能解锁RL后的更高性能上限，在AIME25上相比基线提升42.9%

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一个基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应具有鲁棒性的细胞形态基础表示，能够在无需微调的情况下有效泛化到未见数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练的有效分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建真正的基础模型迈出重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路缺陷检测中存在过检测问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时，需要融合音频信号来提高检测准确性

Method: 使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级(7,16,19)提取特征图，并与音频表示融合，针对铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷进行多模态融合

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合方法相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提升0.2个点，t检验证实了准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合架构有效提升了铁路缺陷检测性能，证明了音频信号在视觉检测任务中的补充价值

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影视角解决了训练数据不可用的问题，在保持高性能的同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一个简单的持续预训练策略，可以在小规模专业领域数据集上有效调整基础模型，无需标签和额外超参数，仅用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等先进模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域小规模数据集上持续预训练的挑战：数据集规模小限制了自监督学习方法的应用，预训练模型通常只提供主干权重缺乏重要信息，超参数搜索不可行。

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，引入的超参数不超过监督微调，能够将任何强大的基础模型引导到新的数据分布。

Result: 方法在不同数据模态和主干网络选择上表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DIET-CP提供了一个简单有效的解决方案，填补了基础模型在小规模专业领域数据集上持续预训练的空白，具有很好的稳定性和实用性。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using

*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，解决了非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，显著提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法虽然高效，但在对抗攻击下容易导致下游任务错误分类。特别是在非IID设置下，存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题，需要提升对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合；通过FedAPT框架整合这些组件来提升对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT通过解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，有效提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ViLD框架，用于评估开源视觉-语言模型在企业应用中的性能，解决学术评测与企业部署需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准依赖多选题和合成数据，无法涵盖真实业务场景的复杂性，需要一个更结合企业部署需求的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，包括logo检测、OCR、对象检测等。设计了BlockWeaver算法来比较无序的OCR输出，并构建了7,500个样本的数据集。结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法来评估描述性输出的完整性和准确性。

Result: 通过对开源VLM模型(Qwen、MIMO、InternVL)进行评测，提供了行业基础的任务驱动性能评估。BlockWeaver算法在比较OCR输出时展现了高速度和高可靠性。

Conclusion: ViLD框架有效地桥接了学术研究与企业部署需求之间的差距，为开源VLM模型在企业环境中的实际部署提供了可操作的见解和指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [46] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头文件学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基准0.847）和ECE 0.036（基准0.058），提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了纯图像网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头文件作为标签，通过三种方法学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行实验。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比X线检测（+0.041 AUROC），校准性提升25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包含去标识化和偏倚审计。该方法虽然效果可能因任务而异，但在外部验证中显示出显著改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Motivation: 研究人类在识别简涂、融合或遮挡字符时的验证能力，并探索先进视觉语言模型是否具备相似的弹性识别能力。

Method: 构建了两个受心理物理学启发的测试标准，涉及中文形声字和英语字母词，通过切割、重组和叠加字形来创建"可见但不可读"的刺激物，而这些刺激物对人类依然可读。

Result: 当代VLMs在这些干扰下性能严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出。模型过于依赖通用视觉不变性，而少了解构成性先验知识。

Conclusion: 研究结果推动需要设计能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构和训练策略，为多模态系统在教育、无障碍访问、文化遗产和安全领域的部署提供了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态和复杂特性，高质量和多样化的k空间数据在实践中很少可用，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的稳健重建

Method: 在频率域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然全局特征空间，并采用时间融合策略集成跨时间帧的k空间数据来优化生成轨迹

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺问题的实际潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有研究主要在狭窄的分类学或视觉相似领域内处理属性预测，但模型是否能在概念上相距较远的类别间抽象和应用属性仍不清楚。

Method: 引入基于LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类别分区的训练-测试分割策略，逐步减少训练集和测试集之间的相关性。

Result: 结果显示随着训练和测试类别相关性降低，性能急剧下降。聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性之间提供了最有效的平衡。

Conclusion: 当前表示方法存在局限性，这些发现为属性推理的未来基准构建提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数表示，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Result: 在生成建模中应用于测试时奖励对齐，特别是在提升美学质量和文本对齐方面，优于现有高斯性正则化方法，有效防止奖励黑客并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的复合正则化损失提供了一个统一框架，能够有效强制标准高斯性，在文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Conclusion: 奖励函数优化框架有效提升了SAM模型在微镜影像分割中的适配性和性能

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

TL;DR: 提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型会系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 1) LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板职业中生成93.0%男性图像，在女性刻板职业中只生成22.5%男性图像；2) 模型存在强烈默认男性偏见，在非刻板职业中68.3%生成男性；3) 不同模型偏见程度差异显著，总体男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%不等。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。最佳表现模型能够去放大性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，获得了最高的公平性分数。这项工作提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化自动化评估工具的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VIO系统向边缘服务器卸载的趋势导致服务器端存在安全威胁，细微的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查。

Method: 提出无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复以保持姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示在轨迹和姿态误差方面相比无防御基线有显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，显著提升系统安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

TL;DR: 人脸增强技术虽然能改善面部外观，但会扭曲生物特征，显著降低深度伪造检测器的准确率，最高攻击成功率可达75.12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些技术是否具有反取证作用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的GAN增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估对Naïve、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 基础增强滤镜可将检测准确率显著降低（ASR达64.63%），GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法可有效作为反取证工具，强调了需要更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习需要大量人工标注，而在开放世界环境中可能会出现新类别。虽然现有工作主要采用半监督方法，但这篇论文进一步插索全无监督方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer通过注意力机制生成向量嵌入，并结合流形学习技术来利用数据的内在几何结构优化嵌入表征，从而提高图像聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上创造了新的单模态聚类和新类发现的最高水平，无论聚类数量是否预先知道。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的全无监督方案来处理开放世界中的新类发现问题，为图像分类预处理提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，通过结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，实现了精准的乳腺超声分割，尤其在小病变和低对比度病变上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声分割对于可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小病变或低对比度病变因模糊边缘和频器噪声而难以准确分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-56fe像线索容易产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet模型，采用双提示双分支设计。全局途径基于CLIP Vision Transformer，编码整体图像语义；局部U-Net途径重点关注精确边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS标准的提示进行调制。提示信息自动从结构化元数据生成，无需手动点击。

Result: 在BLU数据集上进行五折交叉验证，XBusNet达到狭态最高性能，平均Dice系数为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，超迈六个强基线模型。小病变显示最大收益，缺失区域和假阵之激活减少。分离研究证明了全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的补充作用。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计能够有效融合全局语义和局部精度，产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，显著提高了对小病变和低对比度病变的验证性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Method: 使用次空间模型(DPM)进行数据增帿，融合ResNet-50深度特征和U-Net分割胎瘤提取的非线性手工特征，使用XGBoost分类器

Result: 达到了98.0%准确度和98.1%敏感度，DPM增帿和特征融合都是统计显著的关键因素

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同作用能够构建高准确的医学诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: RecA是一种资源高效的后训练方法，通过视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集文本提示，无需标注即可提供丰富监督，显著提升多模态模型的生成和编辑性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致生成质量受限

Method: 提出重建对齐(RecA)方法，利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解与生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也有明显改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种UMM架构，性能超越更大的开源模型

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照遥感图像降低多模态融合互补性、融合阶段冗余信息干扰局部小目标建模、基于Transformer的方法二次计算复杂度难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于线性复杂度Mamba的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在低光照图像增强和目标检测性能方面取得显著改进

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图卷积网络在骨架动作识别中虽然有效，但在区分模糊动作方面存在局限性，学习到的拓扑和空间特征表示不足

Method: 结合高斯滤波器精炼骨架拓扑图，并集成门控循环单元(GRU)到GCN框架中，增强骨架点间的信息传播

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试中表现出色，特别是在模糊样本上显著提升了动作识别效果

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法具有较强的泛化能力，能够有效解决骨架动作识别中模糊动作区分困难的问题

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。GM让高语义节点指导低语义节点的特征更新，通过递归双向交叉注意力和净化实现有效融合

Result: 在主流姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和相应网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过创新的引导模块实现了视觉-语言的有效交互，解决了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计问题，代码将很快发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Motivation: 传统3D资产创建需要大量人力和经验，现有方法主要关注几何建模而忽略纹理合成，需要实现端到端的PBR就绪3D资产自动生成。

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher对齐多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯泼溅，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重光照网格资产。

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，在数据效率和生成质量方面都表现出色，为自动化3D内容创建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: GLEAM框架整合了多模态多视角对齐与可解释对应分析，统一了精确的跨视角匹配与可解释推理，推动了地理定位的透明性和可扩展性

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上实验证明XOCT在en-face投影方面有显著改进，这对视网膜病理临床评估至关重要。

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Motivation: 深度神经网络容易依赖训练数据中的偏见相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生偏见预测，需要一种无需重新训练的后照正确方法

Method: 提出偏见感知机器忘记范式，采用Gradient Ascent、LoRA和Teacher-Student蒸聚等技术选择性移除偏见样本或特征表示

Result: 在CUB-200-2011、CIFAR-10和CelebA三个数据集上实现显著减少子组差异，人口平均改善率分别达到94.86%、30.28%和97.37%，准确率损失最小

Conclusion: 机器忘记作为一种实用框架，可以在不需完全重新训练的情况下有效提升部署视觉系统的公平性

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background

collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient

present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is

contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical

Conclusion: 该方法成功将隐式神经表示与沉淀模型相结合，为向量图形动画自动生成提供了高效的解决方案，充分利用了两种技术的优势

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Motivation: 3DGS在渲染方面效果出色，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建

Method: 为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值，设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略，自适应地在几何一致区域分布高斯

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS一致提高了重建准确性和完整性，同时保持高渲染保真度

Conclusion: DiGS通过将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，实现了表面重建质量和渲染性能的双重提升，为3D重建提供了统一的强几何先验框架

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在遥感应用中容易受到对抗攻击，现有混合策略可能破坏全局语义特征并导致梯度消失问题

Method: 使用局部混合策略生成多样化且语义一致的输入，采用logit损失替代交叉熵损失缓解梯度消失，应用扰动平滑损失抑制高频噪声

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上优于12种最先进方法，在MTARSI上平均黑盒攻击成功率提升17.28%

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部混合和logits优化有效提高了对抗样本的迁移性和攻击效果，为模型鲁棒性研究提供了重要参考

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，现有弱监督方法仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督3D检测方法

Method: 利用时序多视图聚合目标中心点云构建完整3D表示，采用师生蒸馏范式：教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时序聚合的静态对象，学生网络学习从单视图预测伪标签，包含多视图2D投影损失确保一致性

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo Open数据集上达到最先进的弱监督3D检测性能，显著缩小与全监督方法的差距

Conclusion: MVAT框架有效解决了弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊问题，无需任何3D框标注即可实现接近全监督的性能，为3D视觉任务提供了实用的弱监督解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Conclusion: UFC提供了一种高效且通用的少样本控制方法，适用于多种扩散模型架构，显著降低了新控制任务的适应成本。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Conclusion: 领域中心的MIM策略对医学图像表征学习至关重要，HU基于前景遮罩为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of

prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the

directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够实现快速高质量的单图头部重建，为实时渲染应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和质心距离作为节点特征获得了0.76加权F1分数，性能略有提升，并产生更全面的注意力可视化。包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边的模型产生更直观的注意力图。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进模型决策的专家验证。虽然基于牙科数据演示，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，促进透明深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

TL;DR: 本文对基于图像采集流程时间相关痕迹的时间图像取证领域进行了全面综述，分析了已知年龄痕迹特性，提出了新的取证设置，验证了传感器缺陷特性，并揭示了神经网络易受内容偏差影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间图像取证是通过分析图像采集流程中引入的时间相关痕迹来估计数字图像年龄的科学。本文旨在全面综述该领域，验证已知年龄痕迹特性，并揭示现有方法中可能存在的内容偏差问题。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，分析前人工作并重新实现相关实验。具体包括：提出新的取证设置、验证传感器缺陷的主要特性（生长速率和空间分布）、分析神经网络学习特征、以及展示神经网络易受干扰的情况。

Result: 研究发现：基于传感器缺陷的图像年龄估计方法实际上可能利用了其他痕迹（很可能是内容偏差）；验证了传感器缺陷的生长速率和空间分布特性；展示了神经网络容易被从学习年龄痕迹中分散注意力。

Conclusion: 时间图像取证领域需要更加谨慎地处理内容偏差问题，可解释人工智能方法对于验证取证技术可靠性至关重要。本文提出的新取证设置可能更符合实际需求，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或轻微模糊背景），也会导致偏见评分大幅变化，说明现有评估方法可能更多反映模型对虚假特征的响应而非真实的性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征（如物体和背景）之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估的失真。研究旨在探究这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见的评估结果。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）和各种视觉语言模型中的非性别特征，量化这些扰动对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小程度的扰动（如遮挡10%物体或弱模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见评分，生成式视觉语言模型的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%。这表明当前偏见评估往往反映的是模型对虚假特征的响应而非真实的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

TL;DR: CARE框架通过实时安全监控、回滚机制和自省干预策略，在解码阶段实现安全对齐，在安全性和响应质量之间取得更好平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在现实应用中部署时，确保解码过程中输出的安全性成为关键挑战，现有方法往往需要在安全性和响应质量之间做出严重权衡

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)实时安全监控的守卫模型；(2)带令牌缓冲区的回滚机制，可早期高效修正不安全输出；(3)基于自省的干预策略，模型生成对先前输出的自我反思批评，并将这些反思纳入上下文以指导后续解码

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率方面实现了优越的平衡，获得了低有害响应率，对用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确的守卫模型干预、及时的回滚修正和有效的自省方法，实现了优越的安全-质量权衡，为解码时安全对齐提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EICS的新指标，用于量化Transformer电路中功能子图的行为一致性和可信度，结合了层析不一致性和因果涌现的测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏形式化的单次通过方法来量化Transformer电路中活跃子图的行为一致性和可信度，需要一种能够评估电路是否连贯运作的指标。

Method: 基于层析/上同调和因果涌现理论，结合局部雅可比矩阵和激活值计算归一化的层析不一致性，以及从相同前向状态推导出的高斯EI代理来构建EICS指标。

Result: 提出了EICS这一白盒、单次通过的无量纲评分方法，提供了评分解释、计算开销（快速和精确模式）的实用指导，并进行了玩具验证分析。

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的行为一致性和可信度提供了一种新的形式化方法，但还需要在LLM任务上进行实证验证。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密码破解任务作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，需要从26!种可能的映射中选择正确的密码映射。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用仅编码器Transformer和新型双射解码头，通过Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法显式建模排列，实现可解释的密码映射学习。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个独特密码（占可能密码空间的极小部分3.7×10^{-24}）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，并通过早期退出分析揭示了模型逐步优化预测的过程。

Conclusion: 该架构创新和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化和可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: ArGen为构建技术上精通、伦理上稳健且可验证合规的'可治理AI'系统提供了可行路径，适用于全球多样化部署场景

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全频谱的神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板，在频谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和频谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合符号推理的可解释性和神经网络的可扩展性，通过频谱方法解决传统神经符号推理系统在可扩展性和适应性方面的局限性。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板，在知识图谱的频谱域直接执行推理。包含动态图学习、有理滤波器、混合频谱专家、证明引导训练等多种扩展技术。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等推理基准测试中，Spectral NSR相比transformer、消息传递神经网络和神经符号逻辑编程系统，实现了更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗鲁棒性和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了一个可扩展且原则性的基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Result: 在OSWorld的一组所有顶级代理都失败的任务上，Instruction Agent达到了60%的成功率。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high

Conclusion: 语言自我对弈（LSP）为大语言模型的持续改进提供了一种新的途径，能够在不需要额外训练数据的情况下实现性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 是一种新颖的检索方法，通过直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档，而非传统的顺序重排序方法，在有限的重排序预算下显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-重排序流水线存在两个关键限制：受限于初始检索质量，以及LLM重排序器计算需求增长限制了可处理文档数量。

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性策略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，且重排序预算限制在100个文档内。

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序模型对下，策略性地选择重排序文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.
