### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，有效缓解深度学习模型中的伪相关性依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关性，使用非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差

Method: CoBA反偏见数据增强框架：在语义三元组层面操作，先分解文本为主谓宾三元组，然后选择性修改这些三元组来破坏伪相关性，最后重构文本生成反偏见数据

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还能有效减少偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够同时处理多种偏见并提升模型对伪相关性挑战的应对能力

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

### [2] [Mapping Toxic Comments Across Demographics: A Dataset from German Public Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21084)
*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个大规模德语毒性语料集，包含年龄信息和多平台评论，揭示不同年龄组在毒性语言上的差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性语料集缺乏人口统计学上下文，限制了对不同年龄组线上沟通方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集来自Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的评论，通过预定义毒性关键词汇总。注释流程结合了人工专业和先进语言模型，包含3,024个人工注释和30,024个LLM注释评论

Result: 数据集中16.7%评论被标记为有问题，发现年龄基础的毒性语言模式差异：年轻用户偏向表达性语言，年长用户更多参与假消息和质估

Conclusion: 该资源为研究不同人口统计学语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和考虑年龄因素的内容审查系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Motivation: 为了解决笔迹生成中全局依赖关系捕捉和输入文本与生成笔画对齐的问题，需要开发能够有效处理序列依赖关系的模型。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的TrInk模型，在交叉注意力模块中引入缩放位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码来改善对齐效果，并设计了主客观评估流程来全面评估生成笔迹的可读性和风格一致性。

Result: 在IAM-OnDB数据集上，相比之前方法实现了35.56%的字符错误率降低和29.66%的词错误率降低。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the

evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate
(CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset
compared to previous methods. We provide an demo page with handwriting samples

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，与人类类似，推理模型能减轻这种效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中的认知偏见（特别是锚定效应）对其在现实应用中的可靠性影响，以促进LLMs的安全和负责任应用

Method: 使用卖家LLM代理进行价格谈判实验，应用锚定效应，并采用客观和主观指标评估谈判结果，同时考察推理和人格因素的关系

Result: LLMs像人类一样受到锚定效应影响；推理模型较少受锚定效应影响，长思维链能减轻该效应；人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLMs中的认知偏见，为实现LLMs在社会中的安全和负责任应用提供重要见解

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集包含7200张程序生成的图像，测试MLLMs在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着问题复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在简单视觉感知任务上的表现，现有研究主要关注复杂任务，而缺乏对基础感知能力的系统测试。

Method: 创建包含30个类别、7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，测试GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLMs和LRMs的性能。

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在问题复杂度增加时性能显著下降，不同类别表现出相似的趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难。

Conclusion: MLLMs在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基础视觉感知任务上存在明显局限，需要进一步改进底层感知能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见，Claude标签会提升评分而Gemini标签会降低评分，错误标签可导致排名反转和高达50个百分点的评分变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在评估输出时可能存在的偏见问题，特别是自我评估和跨模型评估中的标签影响

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过偏好投票和质量评分（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）评估博客文章

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，需要盲审或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择信息增益最大的问题，在多轮对话中显著提升信息收集能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或外部源收集信息

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，包含精心设计的EIG估计器、不依赖上下文更新的条件化策略以及候选查询的针对性策略

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应设计策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了一个原则性的框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互式接口

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

*Arash Ahmadi,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Banad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过强化学习优化Llama-3.1 8B模型，实现了航空安全事故人因分析的自动化HFACS分类，性能显著提升且超越现有大型语言模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要自动化方案来提高航空安全分析的效率和准确性

Method: 使用强化学习中的GRPO算法对Llama-3.1 8B模型进行微调，构建多组件奖励系统，并集成合成数据生成来解决类别不平衡问题

Result: 模型性能显著提升：精确匹配准确率从0.0400提升到0.1800（增长350%），部分匹配准确率达到0.8800，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-flash等领先模型

Conclusion: 领域优化的小型模型能够提供计算效率更高、性能更好的安全分析方案，适合在资源受限边缘设备上部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来解决自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字符的正字法攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表示替换基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单独的图像，从而增强对噪声输入的鲁棒性并扩展对多语言文本的兼容性

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了方法对正字法噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成语言模型能够有效解决文本模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题，提供更强的鲁棒性和多语言兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [12] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现语音模型在音位习得方面没有明显的关键期效应证据，反而延迟L2接触的模型表现更好，延迟L1接触会导致L1遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键期效应指延迟接触第二语言会增加习得难度，延迟停止接触第一语言会增强第一语言保持。先前研究主要基于文本语言模型，而语音在人类语言习得中起核心作用，语音模型中的关键期效应尚未充分探索。

Method: 在儿童导向语音数据上训练自监督语音模型，设置不同的L2训练开始时间和L1训练结束时间，评估模型的音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型没有表现出明显的音位习得关键期效应。延迟L2接触开始的模型在L2上表现更好，延迟L1接触结束会导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: 语音模型与人类语言习得的关键期模式存在差异，表明当前的自监督语音模型可能无法完全模拟人类语言习得的关键期机制。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

*Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu,Feiyi Wang,Dan Lu,Junqi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的解码内存流水线(DMP)方法，通过识别自我一致性方法中的冗余分共前缀模式，在保持AUROC性能的同时实现了达到3倍的生成速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，现有检测方法在句子级判断上表现较差或依赖领域知识。自我一致性方法虽能解决这些限制，但需要重复生成导致计算成本高。

Method: 识别自我一致性方法中的冗余现象（分享前缀模式），发现非准确答案标记对语义内容贡献最小。基于此提出解码内存流水线(DMP)，通过选择性推理和逆温解码来加速生成。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下实现了达到3倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: DMP方法与模型、数据集、解码策略和自我一致性基准方法都是正交的，能够持续改善多响应生成效率，并有望扩展到对齐和推理任务中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds

TL;DR: 这篇论文重新观察图灵测试，通过统计学上的"正态性"概念推论图灵测试实际上测试的是普通人类智力而非优秀智力，并指出像ChatGPT这样的大语言模型因目标是优秀智力而无法通过真正的图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新考察图灵测试的概念基础，探讨统计学中"正态性"概念如何帮助理解图灵测试的本质和要求。

Method: 从统计学角度解释图灵测试，讨论测试目标是普通人的平均智力水平，以及判断是通过多个判官的统计平均来实现的。

Result: 得出两个主要结论：1）大语言模型因目标是优秀智力而无法通过真正的图灵测试；2）图灵测试能否揭示人类认知的关键在于人类智力是否可被简化为平均智力。

Conclusion: 图灵测试实际上是一种对"正态智力"的测试，而不是对优秀智力的测试，这一视角为理解人工智能的发展方向提供了新的思考。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 调查文本摘要自动评估指标的可复现性挑战，发现文献报告性能与实际实验结果之间存在显著差异

Method: 基于SummEval数据集构建统一开源框架，对6种代表性评估指标（从经典ROUGE到最新LLM方法G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行公平透明比较

Result: 发现结构性权衡：与人类判断最一致的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性差；LLM评估存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限可复现性等关键问题

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动评审生成器在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，其生成的评审内容也没有显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心评审能力上的具体表现和局限性，以确保科学诚信。

Method: 开发了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试各种ARG方法检测研究逻辑一致性的能力。

Result: 与预期相反，研究发现研究逻辑中的缺陷对LLMs生成的评审输出没有显著影响，表明当前ARG方法无法有效识别研究逻辑错误。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三个可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医学AI系统的可靠性和安全性提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法过于粗糙，忽略了细粒度的概念区分，需要更精细的语义维度分解方法

Method: 使用解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)分解大语言模型的词嵌入，生成多个编码特定语义信息的子嵌入，并通过体素编码模型映射到脑激活

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现极性是驱动维度分解的关键因素，神经相关性支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，揭示了语义维度按不同原则组织的结构，为理解语言和大脑中的意义组织提供了新见解

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型存在可量化的意识形态深度差异，深度模型具有更复杂稳定的政治特征，而浅层模型更容易被提示操控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但其稳定性和深度尚不清楚，需要研究这些模型是否具有连贯的内在意识形态结构

Method: 采用双重方法：1)通过指令提示和激活引导测量模型的可操控性；2)使用稀疏自编码器探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征

Result: 发现不同模型的可操控性差异显著，深度模型拥有更独特抽象的政治特征（最多达7.3倍），针对性消融能产生逻辑一致的观点转变

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是大语言模型的可量化属性，可操控性可作为探测其潜在政治架构的重要窗口

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然创意写作能力强但计算需求大，小语言模型是替代方案但现有方法（如SFT和RLHF）存在新颖性不足或成本高的问题

Method: 1) 使用多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2) 通过对抗训练和反思机制优化的原则指导LLM-as-a-Judge方法，直接在强化学习框架中提供奖励信号

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创意输出质量，但原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注数据依赖方面表现更优，自动化评估与人工判断高度一致

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，减少了对人类标注数据的依赖

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Conclusion: 提出的层次选择方法能够有效识别和选择多样化的分类器，从而构建性能更好的集成学习系统，在假新闻检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同演化，为可持续的LLM训练建立了新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

*Peng Yu,En Xu,Bin Chen,Haibiao Chen,Yinfei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QZhou-Embedding是基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct构建的通用文本嵌入模型，采用多任务框架和两阶段训练策略，在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量多样化数据和LLM生成能力来提升检索模型性能。

Method: 使用统一的多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略。采用数据合成管道（包括释义、增强和硬负样本生成）以及两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。

Result: 在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中排名第一（2025年8月27日），同时在重排序、聚类等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 高质量、多样化的数据对提升检索模型性能至关重要，利用LLM生成能力可以进一步优化数据质量，实现嵌入模型的突破。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

*Jonathan Tonglet,Jan Zimny,Tinne Tuytelaars,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Misviz基准数据集，包含2604个真实世界可视化图表和12种误导类型标注，以及Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个图表），用于训练和评估误导性可视化检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大规模、多样化、公开可用的数据集。

Method: 创建了Misviz基准数据集（真实图表标注）和Misviz-synth合成数据集（基于Matplotlib和真实数据表生成），使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 研究结果显示，检测误导性可视化图表仍然是一个极具挑战性的任务，即使是先进模型也难以有效识别。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz和Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为后续研究提供了重要资源，但自动检测误导性可视化仍需要进一步研究突破。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CPI-FT框架，通过核心参数隔离和融合技术解决多任务微调中的跷跷板现象和灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在多任务场景下存在跷跷板现象，某些任务性能提升以牺牲其他任务为代价，需要解决任务干扰和遗忘问题

Method: 1) 独立微调识别核心参数区域 2) 基于区域重叠的任务聚类 3) 核心参数移植+非核心参数SLERP融合 4) 冻结核心区域的轻量级流水线训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著缓解任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于传统多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调中的关键挑战，为LLM适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理密集型回归(RiR)任务，针对需要从文本中推断微妙数值属性的场景，并开发了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在基准测试中取得了65%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中进行深度分析来推断数值属性，但现有的冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化（batch-reflective prompt optimization）和神经集成学习（neural ensemble learning），这是一个简单轻量级的解决方案。

Result: 在三个现实问题构建的基准测试中，MENTAT方法相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer微调两个基线方法，取得了最高65%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT在推理密集型回归任务上取得了显著进步，但该领域仍有很大的改进空间，需要未来的进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然评分来选择最佳推理链，在数学推理任务上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来识别正确推理链的关键挑战

Method: 使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然作为评分函数，自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度

Result: 在MATH500上提升10.18分，在AIME2025上提升9.81分，在20次比较中16次以至少2倍更少样本超越基线

Conclusion: 正确推理链表现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了实时数据集分析的能力，为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化系统来辅助牙科诊断，提高牙齿状况分类的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN与传统分类器的混合模型、以及微调的预训练架构。采用5折交叉验证，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%）。混合模型在形态相似状况的区分上表现更好。

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器相结合为自动化牙科诊断支持提供了实用途径，但需要更大的数据集和进一步的临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射、Key-Value重排增强特征对应、使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面超越现有最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更准确的语义对齐和更好的视觉效果

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存引入的累积误差并联合修正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差，实现2倍推理加速同时保持甚至提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单重用会导致明显的质量下降，需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型分析近似缓存引起的误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时一致保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速下VBench退化最小，有效保持基线保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差并提出联合修正方法，成功解决了扩散模型缓存加速中的质量退化问题，为高效采样提供了准确且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，解决视频大语言模型在细粒度时间语义理解上的挑战，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和帧间理解监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义，而人类自然通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选和关注显著时间段落

Method: 提出时间视觉筛选(TVS)任务：(1)保留重点关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询到最直接形式保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务，可集成到视频指令循环和视频问答流水线中

Result: 构建了首个TVS标准测试集，提出的ReSimplifyIt基线方法在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法F-1分数提升0.47，查询重写性能达到竞争水平。实验显示集成TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%相对提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%相对提升

Conclusion: TVS通过优化理解负荷分配和认知负荷，在训练时对齐查询与重点视觉信息，在推理时支持查询感知段落聚焦和流程化查询表征，显示了时间信息筛选对改善视频-语言理解的有效性

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，无需模型特定调整，在多个模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，且需要大量模型特定调整，存在局限性。

Method: 采用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，将安全控制信号注入到锁定的T2I模型中，以补丁形式进行更新，支持灵活合并多个安全补丁。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他七种最先进的安全机制（约20%）。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效、灵活且兼容性强的安全解决方案，能显著减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像的质量和文本对齐。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车于五个不同地理区域的真实世界实验中，展现了优异的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV成功解决了stuff-type目标区域识别难题，在复杂真实环境中表现出色，为移动设备的自然语言导航任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启动思维过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在解决复杂推理问题时采用逐步思维过程，但对于简单问题这种思维过程是冗余的，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思维和非思维两种能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否启动思维过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上进行训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506(16B)模型性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制有效解决了多模态大语言模型在简单问题上的计算冗余问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡，为高效的多模态推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的多模态方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Motivation: 解决传统"渲染比较"方法在CT/X射线配准中存在的空间信息丢失和域差距问题，以及现有双平面X射线3D重建方法对密集视图要求和噪声处理的局限性。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并采用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合重建和配准的方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要构建大规模合成数据集来推动3D建筑生成算法的发展。

Method: 创建包含超过620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4级别的语义丰富3D线框图、对应的平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中推导而来。

Result: 成功构建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，提供了大规模、多样化、多模态的3D建筑数据，包含房间、门窗等语义信息，为开发生成式AI算法奠定了基础。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集为自动化创建LoD 4级别3D建筑模型提供了重要资源，支持在预定义平面布局和屋顶几何条件下开发语义-几何一致性的生成算法，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响单应性估计的准确性。过去的研究分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、相同畸变和独立畸变。基于该方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中，所提出的求解器在所有三种情况下都比现有最先进求解器更快，同时保持相似的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，新求解器在速度和准确性方面表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的概念表示方法。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，并提出TGCAV方法进行评估。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著减少TCAV分数的方差，保持概念相关性，有效缓解跨层概念不一致，增强概念定位能力，提高对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解框架，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在上下文中使用示例作为提示，使模型能够直接泛化到未见过的物体类别，无需参数调整或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉对重识别至关重要的身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM（如DINO）通过动态视觉提示提取身份判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个重识别基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的性能明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将LLM衍生的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐，实现了对新类别的泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求，为物体重识别提供了有效的少样本学习解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在Auto3DSeg架构下，针对MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务进行训练评估，在PANTHER挑战赛的两个任务中表现中等，突显了小数据集下MRI序列差异带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，使用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: 任务1：DSC 0.56，5 mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1 mm，MASD 26.0 mm，RMSE 5164 mm；任务2性能下降：DSC 0.33，5 mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1 mm，MASD 7.2 mm，RMSE 17203 mm。

Conclusion: 尽管性能一般，结果显示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过反推底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型在不同成像序列间泛化能力差，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异，但这些图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）从观测的MRI图像反推底层自旋属性，通过求解非线性逆问题；2）使用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于估计的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像获得有意义且可解释的自旋属性估计，实现高度灵活的图像合成，使分割模型在不同图像对比度和成像协议间实现高度准确的分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法追求通用性但忽略了用户特定身体形状，过度依赖2D约束会损害3D精度，需要一种能同时考虑个性化形状和3D姿态合理性的方法。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器构建形状条件化的3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代引导姿态拟合。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块提升现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，在保持数据效率的同时显著提升了3D姿态估计精度。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了涵盖模型在3D人体姿势估计中的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升识别性能，证明了该方法在克服数据稀缺方面的有效性

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频的人工分析耗时且繁琐，而现有计算机视觉方法缺乏足够的医疗样本数据，特别是在子宫内膜异位症领域

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建了包含区域标注的妇科腹腔镜子宫内膜异位症图像数据集

Result: 成功发布了首个此类数据集GLENDA，为子宫内膜异位症的计算机视觉分析提供了宝贵资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析的自动化方法发展，有助于治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用区域全卷积网络对腹腔镜妇科手术视频中的手术器械进行实例分割和识别，实现了较高的器械定位和分割精度，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息来源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频档案搜索基础）由于特殊的视频内容仍然是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割（二值分割）和(2)器械识别（多类别识别）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量较少，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但由于手术器械固有的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍是需要进一步解决的难题。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for

components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

TL;DR: 提出一种用于生物全手片图像（WSI）的二维索引地图和域特定配置机制，解决大规模WSI集合内容识别的标准化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化的元数据，目前WSI集群的选择主要依靠手动检查，这对包含数百万对象的大规模集合不可行

Method: 提出一种通用框架，为每个WSI集合添加详细的组织地图，该地图包含三个层次：来源、组织类型和病理改变，每个层都将WSI的区域分配到特定类别

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证，使用通用语法和语义实现了不同目录之间的互操性

Conclusion: 该标准在WSI目录、机器学习和图基于图表示方面都显示出明显优势和应用性，为大规模AI算法训练和验证提供了重要支撑

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度伪标签的无监督增量学习方法ICPL，能够在无标注数据集上进行增量学习，性能接近有监督方法，在最终准确率上比最先进的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型能够增量学习新知识。现有的类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实。

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制处理无标注数据集。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法获得竞争性结果，比state-of-the-art class-iNCD方法最终准确率高5%以上，在细粒度数据集上验证了实用性，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境。

Conclusion: ICPL方法能够有效解决无标注数据的增量学习问题，在性能和实用性方面都表现出色，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

TL;DR: MedShift是一个基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一类条件生成模型，用于解决合成与真实X射线图像之间的跨域转换问题，在医学影像领域实现了高保真度的无配对图像转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然提供了可扩展的训练解决方案，但由于显著的领域差距限制了其在真实临床环境中的泛化能力。需要解决合成与真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表示等方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges构建统一的类条件生成模型。该方法学习共享的领域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任何领域对之间的无缝转换，无需领域特定训练或配对数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管模型规模比基于扩散的方法小，MedShift仍表现出强大的性能，在推理时保持灵活性，可以调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学影像领域的域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，在X-DigiSkull新数据集上验证了其有效性，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平识别单株树木，大尺度单株树木监测存在建模不足的问题。

Method: 使用3米分辨率PlanetScope影像，采用高斯核模拟可缩放大小的树冠，从机载激光雷达数据自动提取数十亿个点进行训练，建立深度学习检测模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为全球高分辨率树木监测提供了可扩展框架，并能适应未来提供改进影像的卫星任务。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Result: 在保持优异视觉质量的同时，显著减少了训练时间，相比现有最优方法有显著提升

Conclusion: M框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，在训练效率和渲染质量方面都取得了突破

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在本地设备部署时计算需求高的问题，开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述模型。

Method: 首先实现基于125M参数语言模型的专家模型，然后开发Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表示来改善注意力机制和视觉表示限制。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，新框架成功解决了视觉盲点问题，证明了小模型在图像描述任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么只关注单一技术家族，要么在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽视了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，统一最先进的OOD检测器到一个更有效的评分函数中，结合特征截断和多种评分函数

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，涵盖近OOD和远OOD场景，MME在所有基准测试中显著优于最新方法。使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上实现平均FPR95为27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效地结合，聚合多个评分函数能增强对各种类型OOD样本的鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于数据变换的对抗攻击方法过度增强图像背景或无关区域，可能引入不必要的干扰导致误检，这些错误并非由对抗补丁本身引起。

Method: 提出局部增强方法，仅对目标区域进行增强，避免影响非目标区域，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，使对抗攻击更专注于目标区域，显著提升了攻击效果和迁移能力。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉。之前的基准主要关注短视频，而忽视了长视频中由于语义复杂性增加导致的语义聚合幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了ELV-Halluc基准，专门用于长视频幻觉研究；通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的关系；采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH问题；构建了包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，并发现其随着语义复杂度的增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；位置编码策略有助于缓解SAH；DPO策略显著减少了27.7%的SAH比例，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得了改进。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的基准和方法来解决。位置编码和DPO策略是有效的缓解手段，为未来长视频多模态理解研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种卷积神经网络上采样器，将低分辨率基础模型特征与输入图像结合进行上采样，用于高效处理显微图像分割任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于patch的基础模型特征在显微图像分析中存在两个问题：1）难以表示显微图像中的精细特征；2）处理大尺寸图像时计算效率低

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝状裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快的速度产生高质量分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了显微图像分割的效率和准确性，特别是在处理精细特征和大尺寸图像方面表现出色

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCCM框架通过区域-全局图像文本对比学习和匹配学习，解决了无人机场景中视觉语言理解的细粒度语义缺失问题，在GeoText-1652数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在未见数据集上展现强大的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中的宽视场和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解构成挑战，主流VLM模型缺乏细粒度语义，现有分层方法依赖精确实体划分，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: 提出HCCM框架，包含：1）区域-全局图像文本对比学习（RG-ITC），避免精确场景划分，通过对比局部视觉区域与全局文本来捕获分层语义；2）区域-全局图像文本匹配（RG-ITM），评估全局跨模态表示中的局部语义一致性；3）动量对比和蒸馏机制（MCD）提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上实现28.8%（图像检索）和14.7%（文本检索）的Recall@1；在未见ERA数据集上达到39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的细粒度视觉语言理解问题，无需精确场景划分和严格约束，在标准数据集和零样本场景下均表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过潜在漫散模型和自监督学习方法，从单张图像生成完整的3D场景高斯拟合，包括遮挡部分的多种可能性重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯拟合需要密集观测且无法处理遮挡和未观测区域，回归方法只能预测单一模式导致模糊和不真实的结果

Method: 使用变分自动重构器从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间，然后在潜在空间上训练漫散模型，通过生成式方法学习条件化的高斯拟合3D表示分布

Result: 方法能够生成准确的重建结果和多样化样本，完成遮挡表面的重建，产生高质量的360度渲染结果

Conclusion: 通过生成式潜在漫散模型提供了一种有效的方法，能够从单张图像生成完整且多样化的3D场景重建，解决了传结方法在遮挡区域处理上的限制

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对比较在主观标注任务中更可靠，但传统方法需要O(n^2)次标注，成本过高。需要更高效的标注方法来减少人工负担

Method: 结合CLIP零样本预排序、桶感知Elo分数初始化和不确定性引导的归并排序，用自动化比较替代明显的人类比较

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，相比穷举成对比较减少90.5%人工标注，比先前工作减少19.8%标注成本，同时保持或提高评分可靠性

Conclusion: CLIP先验知识与不确定性感知采样相结合，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，从第一人称视角建模人-物交互成为一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。研究旨在探索仅通过头部和手腕追踪能恢复多少交互信息。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，联合建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列。在头部中心规范空间中操作，增强全局方向鲁棒性。提出基于传送带的推理方法，可处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在性能上超越了现有方法，在自我中心人-物交互重建方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了一个统一的框架，能够从最小化的观测数据中灵活恢复人-物交互的多种模态信息，为可穿戴设备应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在通用场景上领域训练，但在城市场景的细粒度空间推理能力转移效果不明，需要探索这一领域的挑战性。

Method: 构建了一个基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，配合LLM生成的链式思维答案进行步骤推理监督，对BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三款VLMs进行了零样本和细调比较。

Result: 结果显示VLMs在零样本设置下表现良好，但使用我们的合成CoT监督数据集进行细调后性能显著提升，尤其是在具有挑战性的否定和反事实问题类型上。

Conclusion: 本研究将城市空间推理作为VLMs的新挑战，并证明了合成数据集构建是将通用模型适配到专业领域的实用途径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法要么只考虑单一时间上下文，要么局限于分类回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且大多限于单时间点或特定疾病

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - 统一的生成式轨迹方法，学习底层时间分布，支持回退到最近图像预测，处理3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基线

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学图像时间动态建模的基本空白，为疾病进展建模、治疗规划和解剖发育跟踪等应用提供了强大的统一框架

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个多模态深度学习框架，整合术前CT影像和术后病理切片来预测透明细胞肾癌复发风险，发现病理信息比影像信息更具预后价值，中间融合策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分系统在透明细胞肾癌复发风险评估中存在局限性，缺乏患者级别的分辨率且未包含影像信息，需要开发更精准的多模态预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置，比较了CT和病理切片的表现。

Result: 病理切片模型始终优于仅使用CT的模型，中间融合进一步提升了性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。影像信息通过融合提供了附加价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中的可行性，未来需要探索更具表达力的融合策略、更大的多模态数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复数去噪器(PCD)。ABPM支持更宽的工作距离，PCD利用复数变形自注意力模块捐捕全局特征。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理模型和深度学习的优势，提供了更高性能、更好可解释性和更宽工作范围的CGH解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Conclusion: 基于几何映射的概率投影机制能有效提升高清地图构建精度，通过置信度过滤和时序优化解决了现有方法的幻觉问题，实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，现代技术虽然通过单词级处理避免了字符分割问题，但单词分割又成为了新的瓶颈。为了进一步提升OCR准确率和效率，需要向行级OCR发展。

Method: 提出从单词级OCR向行级OCR的自然演进方法，直接处理整行文本图像，绕过单词检测步骤，利用更大的句子上下文来更好地应用语言模型。

Conclusion: 行级OCR是OCR技术发展的自然演进方向，不仅能提高准确率，还能显著提升效率，特别是在大语言模型不断改进的背景下，这种方法具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法需要企业级GPU和大量合成图像的高计算成本问题

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应(LoRA)进行微调，大幅降低计算需求

Result: 在7个目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像就比ODGEN基线5000张图像性能提升高达21.3% mAP

Conclusion: 质量优先的效率方法比暴力生成更有效，使先进合成数据生成更实用和易于获取

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data

TL;DR: 通过监测CNN激活层熵值变化来检测对抗样本，无需修改模型即可实现90%检测准确率，误报率和漏报率低于20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗样本检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络结构或影响原始模型性能，而对抗扰动会在CNN激活层中产生可检测的熵特征

Method: 在VGG-16网络上并行监测激活熵值，发现对抗输入在早期卷积层中使激活熵产生7%的偏移

Result: 对抗样本与干净样本的熵分布完全分离，检测准确率达到90%，误报率和漏报率均低于20%

Conclusion: CNN的可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，实现了无需修改模型即可实时检测对抗样本的自诊断视觉系统

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了SSL-SaN自监督模型，通过引入静音和噪声训练策略，在视觉声源定位任务中提升了正例性能并增强了对负音频的鲁棒性，同时提出了新的评估指标和扩展数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉声源定位方法在低音频-视觉语义对应场景（如静音、噪声、屏幕外声音）表现不佳，且现有评估主要局限于单一可见声源的正例场景。

Method: 提出包含静音和噪声的新训练策略，开发自监督模型SSL-SaN；提出新的评估指标量化正负音频-视觉对的特征对齐和分离性；扩展IS3合成数据集为IS3+。

Result: SSL-SaN在声源定位和跨模态检索任务中达到最先进的性能，在正例情况下表现更好，同时对负音频更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视觉声源定位中的负音频挑战，提供了更全面的评估框架，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Motivation: GUI代理是实现自动化移动/PC设备操作的重要任务，但面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型初始能力有限等挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调处理各种GUI场景的感知和规划任务，开发课程强化学习框架支持复杂推理和在线环境探索，并建立了连接移动和PC设备的交互环境。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统性数据工程和交互基础设施的建立，推动了GUI代理向实际应用迈进一步，解决了现有解决方案在中文能力方面的普遍不足。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强领域感知和分离领域特征来提升CLIP在域泛化任务中的性能，特别是在分布外数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化评估方法对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖许多基准测试。需要更好的方法来评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中分离实现领域不变分类。

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更分布外的数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型实现有效领域不变分类的前提条件，CLIP-DCA通过分离分类和领域感知表示的方法成功提升了域泛化性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

TL;DR: 本文研究了非典型视频数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别任务中带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对不常见的新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据，视频领域的开放世界新发现研究不足。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据的新数据集，将其用于模型训练进行表示学习，重点研究OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 使用非典型数据的简单学习方法在各种设置下都能持续提升性能；增加非典型样本的类别多样性进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用更小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表示学习有益，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域研究不足。现有研究依赖标签和任务边界，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为非参数概率表征。通过新奇检测来动态扩展内存集群，并利用过往任务的过移学习。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了模型在连续学习多个任务时的性能，为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也表现出良好的正确性和全面性，但仍有改进空间且需要专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专门针对肿瘤学优化的GPT-5大语言模型在临床决策支持中的表现，特别是在放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤病例。由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估治疗建议的正确性、全面性和幻觉现象。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见。但在复杂场景中仍存在错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，但生成的建议仍需专家严格监督，不能直接用于临床实践，特别是在需要精确试验知识或详细临床适应的复杂情况下。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made

Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，这种单标签设定无法处理语义重叠问题。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb MLP模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界，并设计了多标签评估基准。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的平均精度均值(MAP)提升。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型能有效处理视觉场景识别中的语义模糊性，为场景识别研究提供了新的视角和评估标准。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach

### [93] [DriveQA: Passing the Driving Knowledge Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21824)
*Maolin Wei,Wanzhou Liu,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调和预训练可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要创建更全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的各个方面。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调和预训练实验。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性；3) DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素(光照、视角、距离、天气)的敏感性；4) 预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估驾驶AI系统提供了全面的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，同时证明了通过适当的训练方法可以显著提升模型在复杂驾驶场景中的理解和推理能力。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于无人机影像和多模态大语言模型的农村宜居性评估框架，通过大规模数据收集和智能算法，揭示了中国农村宜居性的空间格局和影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前农村宜居性评估方法存在局限，问卷调查难以规模化，城市导向的视觉感知方法不适用于农村环境，需要开发专门针对农村的评估框架。

Method: 采用自上而下方法收集1766个村庄的无人机影像，开发高效的图像对比机制和思维链提示，结合专家知识构建包含生活质量和生态宜居性维度的评估体系。

Result: 发现中国农村宜居性呈现以四川和浙江为核心的双核-边缘空间格局，政府财政支出是核心影响因素，每增加1个单位可使宜居性提升3.9-4.9个单位。

Conclusion: 该研究为农村建设政策制定提供了有价值的见解，证明了多模态大语言模型在农村环境评估中的有效应用。

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需骨架、数据驱动的框架，用于处理未注册表面网格的运动预测和迁移，通过运动嵌入网络和顶点特征场生成时空变形场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未注册表面网格（特别是原始3D扫描）由于缺乏点对点对应关系和存在数据噪声，给自动计算合理变形带来了重大挑战。

Method: 将鲁棒的运动嵌入网络与学习的每顶点特征场耦合，生成时空变形场来驱动网格变形。

Result: 在行走和跑步等任务上的广泛评估（包括定量基准和定性可视化）证明了该方法在挑战性未注册网格上的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理未注册网格的运动预测和迁移提供了一种有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 基于SuGaR模型的两种正则化策略：有效秩正则化控制向异性度，神经SDF提供全局表面前知，提升3D高斯拖散的网格重建质量和场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如SuGaR在3D高斯拖散(3DGS)的网格重建中，在视觉保真度和场景一致性方面仍有改进空间，需要解决单个高斯元形状和整体表面一致性的问题。

Method: 1. 有效秩正则化：控制高斯元的向异性度，避免"针状"形状，促进更平衡的"盘状"形式；2. 神经SDF正则化：通过Eikonal损失维护距离属性，提供连续全局表面前知，引导高斯元与基础几何更好对齐。

Result: 方法能够提升单个高斯元的保真度和它们的集体表面行为，从3DGS数据中生成更准确和一致的视觉效果。

Conclusion: 通过两种补充性正则化策略，有效改善了3D高斯拖散的网格重建质量，在保持渲染效果的同时提升了形状稳定性和场景一致性。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库规范化对保持数据完整性至关重要，但传统手动方法耗时且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 采用双模型自优化架构：生成模块消除异常，验证模块提供反馈，循环优化直至满足规范化要求；设计任务特定的零样本提示词

Result: 实验结果表明Miffie能够规范化复杂数据库模式并保持高精度

Conclusion: Miffie框架成功实现了自动化数据库规范化，无需人工干预且保持高准确性，为解决数据库规范化问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在苏格拉底式辅导中的认知行为和推理能力，探索通过架构设计来塑造模型的教学策略。

Method: 引入符号脚手架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的控制性消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准和基于LLM的评估框架进行系统性比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有评估维度上一致优于基线变体，移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键认知行为（抽象、适应性探测和概念连续性）的表现。

Conclusion: 架构脚手架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集来全面评估10个重要方面，包括感知、推理、公平性等，并标准化了评估流程。测试了14个模型，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在5个方面表现最佳但存在公平性问题，基线系统表现意外良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要方面。不同评估使用不同的提示方法和推理参数，导致模型间难以比较。

Method: 引入AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，在10个重要方面全面评估音频-语言模型性能。

Result: 测试了14个开源和闭源API模型及3个基线系统。Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具备语音转文本能力的系统总体排名第5。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了音频-语言模型的全面标准化评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和局限性，特别是公平性问题。基准将持续更新，促进该领域的发展。所有评估数据和结果公开透明。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Motivation: 推荐系统中的公平性通常分为群体公平和个体公平，但两者关系缺乏科学理解，现有研究使用不同评估指标无法进行直接比较，不清楚提升一种公平性如何影响另一种。

Method: 通过全面比较可用于两种公平性类型的评估指标，在3个数据集上对8个运行结果进行实验分析。

Result: 实验表明，对群体高度公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平，两者之间存在明显冲突。

Conclusion: 这一发现对推荐系统从业者改进系统公平性具有重要价值，揭示了群体公平与个体公平之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决视觉引导四足运动控制问题，强调结合本体感觉和视觉对于鲁棒控制的必要性

Method: 提出QuadKAN框架：使用样条编码器处理本体感觉，样条融合头处理多模态输入；采用MMDR和PPO进行端到端训练

Result: 在多种地形（平坦/不平坦、静态/动态障碍物）上评估，相比SOTA基线获得更高回报、更远距离、更少碰撞

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒视觉引导运动提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型强化学习中的反直觉现象（如单样本训练、不精确奖励信号、负样本训练等）仅在模型与任务已高度对齐时有效，而在更具挑战性的场景中，标准RL方法仍然更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现LLM强化学习中出现了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件和失败情况尚不明确，需要系统研究其背后的关键因素。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域中检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注模型-任务对齐程度（以pass@k准确率衡量）的影响。

Result: 研究表明，许多反直觉结果只在模型与任务已高度对齐时出现，而在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习，标准RL方法仍然有效。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，标准RL训练在各种设置中保持稳健，而反直觉方法仅在特定条件下有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Motivation: 随着LLM在高风险决策任务中的应用增加，需要评估其在处理表格数据时的性能和公平性表现，特别是在贷款审批等金融决策场景中

Method: 使用来自加纳、德国和美国的序列化贷款审批数据集，评估LLM的零样本学习和上下文学习能力，比较不同序列化格式(GReat、LIFT等)的效果

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响LLM性能和公平性，某些格式如GReat和LIFT能提高F1分数但加剧公平性差距；ICL相对零样本基线提升性能4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异

Conclusion: 需要开发有效的表格数据表示方法和关注公平性的模型，以提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

TL;DR: InsightTab是一个基于洞察蒸馏的框架，通过规则总结、策略示例和反思学习，帮助大语言模型更好地处理表格分类任务，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理表格数据分类时存在挑战，因为结构化数据的变异性较大，需要将数据蒸馏为可操作的洞察来提高分类效果。

Method: 提出InsightTab框架，采用分治法、简单优先和反思学习原则，结合规则总结、策略示例和洞察反思，通过大语言模型与数据建模技术的深度协作来实现数据洞察蒸馏。

Result: 在9个数据集上的广泛评估显示，InsightTab相比最先进方法取得了持续改进，消融研究验证了原则引导的蒸馏过程的有效性。

Conclusion: InsightTab框架能够有效利用标注数据并管理偏差，使大语言模型能够更好地将其通用知识和能力与特定表格任务的要求对齐。

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ActSub方法，通过奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将激活分解为决定性分量和无关分量，分别处理远分布偏移和近分布偏移的OOD检测问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本。现有方法在处理不同分布偏移程度时存在局限性

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为对分类输出贡献最大的决定性分量和贡献最小的无关分量。针对远分布偏移(Far-OOD)使用无关分量，针对近分布偏移(Near-OOD)使用决定性分量

Result: 在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的检测性能

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过分析分类头权重的奇异值分解，有效利用激活空间的不同子空间来处理不同程度的分布偏移，为OOD检测提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

*Peng Yang,Zhengdong Huang,Zicheng Xie,Wentao Tian,Jingyu Liu,Lunhong Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个处理心率预测中数据异质性（设备源异质性和用户异质性）的框架，通过随机特征丢弃和时间感知注意力模块，在新建的ParroTao数据集和FitRec数据集上分别取得17%和15%的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界心率预测面临的两个关键异质性挑战：设备源异质性（不同设备特征集差异）和用户异质性（个体生理模式差异），现有方法无法同时处理这两种异质性

Method: 提出一个学习对两种异质性不敏感的潜在表示框架：使用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，采用时间感知注意力模块捕获长期生理特征，结合对比学习目标构建判别性表示空间

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上分别比现有基线方法提升17%和15%，学习到的表示具有很强的判别能力，下游应用任务验证了模型的实用价值

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，学习到的表示对设备特征差异和用户生理差异都具有鲁棒性，在现实世界部署中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Nripesh Niketan,Vaatsalya Shrivastva*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: CrossTL是一个通用的编程语言翻译器，通过统一的中间表示CrossGL实现多种编程语言之间的双向翻译，支持CUDA、HIP、Metal、HLSL、GLSL、SPIR-V、Rust和Mojo等语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每对语言单独开发翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。CrossTL旨在通过统一的中间表示解决这个问题，实现"一次编写，到处部署"的开发模式。

Method: 系统包含语言特定的词法分析器/解析器将源代码转换为AST，双向CrossGL翻译模块（ToCrossGLConverter用于导入代码，CodeGen用于目标生成），以及处理完整翻译流程的后端实现。

Result: 通过跨编程领域的全面评估，在所有支持的后端上实现了成功的编译和执行。统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需开发语言特定的前端/后端组件。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，证明了通用代码翻译的实际可行性，其模块化架构支持可扩展性，能够处理GPU计算、图形编程和系统语言等多种编程范式。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

*Anna Geißler,Luca-Sophie Bien,Friedrich Schöppler,Tobias Hertel*

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在本科热力学教学中尚未达到95%的能力阈值，最佳模型准确率仅为82%，特别是在图像推理和不可逆过程场景中表现不佳，不适合无监督辅导使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在科学教育中作为辅导工具的可行性，特别是测试其在需要原则性推理的热力学领域的表现，因为可靠的教学需要超越流畅回忆的一致推理能力。

Method: 创建了包含50个本科热力学问题的UTQA基准测试，涵盖理想气体过程、可逆性和图表解释等主题，测试了2025年领先的语言模型在这些问题上的表现。

Result: 没有模型达到95%的能力阈值，最佳LLM准确率为82%；文本题目表现优于图像推理任务（后者接近随机水平）；提示措辞和句法复杂性对性能影响有限；在有限速率/不可逆场景和视觉特征与热力学意义绑定方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在热力学领域尚未具备无监督辅导的适用性，特别是在处理图像推理和不可逆过程等需要深度概念理解的任务时表现不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究通过两个实验探讨巴西儿童使用对话代理的学习模式，并开发结构化脚手架提示方法提升交互效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究巴西儿童如何利用对话代理进行学习、探索和娱乐，以及如何通过结构化支持来改善儿童与AI的互动质量。

Method: 研究1：对23名参与者进行7周在线调查，使用访谈、观察和认知工作分析法；研究2：使用GPT-4o-mini在1200个模拟对话中测试结构化提示方法。

Result: 识别出对话代理的三大功能（学业、探索、娱乐），结构化提示方法在可读性、问题深度和连贯性方面优于非结构化基线。

Conclusion: 提出设计建议：脚手架式对话树、儿童专用配置文件、监护人策划内容，为儿童-AI互动提供了有效的结构化支持框架。

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

*Yi-Hao Peng,Dingzeyu Li,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae是一个为盲人和低视力用户设计的UI代理，通过识别决策点并暂停执行来让用户参与选择，相比传统端到端代理提高了任务完成率和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常以端到端方式执行任务，不涉及用户在关键选择中的参与，也不告知重要上下文信息，这降低了用户的自主权。研究发现BLV用户在购买决策中希望了解替代产品和不同选择。

Method: Morae使用大型多模态模型解析用户查询、UI代码和屏幕截图，在执行过程中自动识别决策点并暂停，提示用户进行澄清和选择。

Result: 在真实网页任务研究中，Morae相比基线代理（包括OpenAI Operator）帮助用户完成了更多任务，并选择了更符合偏好的选项。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了一种混合主动方法，用户既能从UI代理的自动化中受益，又能表达自己的偏好，提高了用户代理权。

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了量子文本生成模型与传统Transformer模型的性能对比，发现Transformer在总体性能上仍然领先，但量子模型在特定场景下表现竞争力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因对量子计算在自然语言处理领域应用的日益增长兴趣，需要系统性地评估量子文本生成模型的性能与传统模型的对比

Method: 使用5种不同模型（Transformer、QKSAN、QRWKV、QASA）在5个多样化数据集上进行实验，采用迷因子、BLEU分数、词汇多样性、重复率和流畅度等多种指标进行评估

Result: Transformer模型在总体性能上最优（平均迷因子1.21，BLEU-1分数0.2895），但量子模型在特定方面表现突出：QKSAN实现了零重复率和竞争性BLEU-1分数（0.2800），QRWKV在某些任务中实现了完美词汇多样性

Conclusion: 传统Transformer模型仍然是文本生成的最优选择，但量子受启发模型在特定性能指标上显示出竞争力，为量子计算在NLP领域的应用提供了有价值的参考

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.
