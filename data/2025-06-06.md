### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes GEM, a self-supervised method to enable decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems use separate embedding models for tasks like RAG, complicating the system and causing discrepancies. GEM aims to unify these capabilities within LLMs.

Method: GEM inserts special tokens and manipulates attention masks to generate text embeddings, compatible with post-training or fine-tuning of existing LLMs.

Result: Applied to LLMs (1B-8B parameters), GEM improves text embedding performance (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP tasks (MMLU).

Conclusion: GEM successfully enhances LLMs with embedding capabilities while preserving their original performance, simplifying systems like RAG.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Increasing speaker count in ASR training data improves robustness to unseen accents more than increasing audio duration per speaker or accent diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR robustness for diverse accents, especially unseen ones, in low-resource settings.

Method: Studied the impact of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity in training data on ASR performance.

Result: More speakers (with less audio per speaker) improves ASR robustness; accent diversity has minimal impact when speaker count is fixed.

Conclusion: Prioritize increasing speaker count in ASR training data for better performance on unseen accents.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning, revealing linear encoding of semantic and syntactic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentence embeddings lack human-interpretable structure due to complex neural transformations and pooling, making their content untraceable.

Method: Proposes dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose embeddings and analyze pooling's role in feature compression.

Result: Reveals that semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in embeddings, enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Bridges token-level and sentence-level interpretability, enabling more transparent and controllable representations.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP combines label hierarchy and text encoding via contrastive learning, improving HTC performance by 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTC models handle label hierarchy and text encoding separately or guide hierarchy in the encoder, missing complementary benefits.

Method: HTC-CLIP uses contrastive learning to merge hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations, pooling probabilities for inference.

Result: Achieves 0.99-2.37% higher Macro F1 on benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Combining label hierarchy and text encoding in one architecture enhances HTC performance effectively.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, finding poor performance, especially on generative tasks, with smaller fine-tuned models outperforming others. Key factors include prior exposure to Maltese and trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLM performance on low-resource languages like Maltese, addressing gaps in inclusivity and effectiveness.

Method: Evaluated 55 LLMs using a new benchmark covering 11 tasks, analyzing factors like pre-training exposure and fine-tuning vs. prompting.

Result: Many LLMs perform poorly, especially on generative tasks; smaller fine-tuned models excel. Prior exposure to Maltese is crucial.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for inclusive language tech and recommends traditional approaches for low-resource languages, emphasizing fine-tuning's benefits.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model for few-shot intent classification in customer care, improving accuracy by 20-23% over SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care requires domain-specific intent classifiers, but annotated data is scarce across domains (geography, channel, language).

Method: An embedder-cum-classifier model with supervised fine-tuning, isotropic regularizers, and multilingual knowledge distillation.

Result: 20-23% accuracy improvement on Canada and Mexico datasets for few-shot intent detection.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generalizes across domains with minimal annotations, offering practical value for e-commerce customer care.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale language models generalize form but not meaning of rare constructions like LET-ALONE, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether language models generalize both form and meaning of rare constructions as humans do.

Method: Testing human-scale transformer models on a synthetic benchmark for the rare LET-ALONE construction, evaluating syntactic and semantic properties.

Result: Models generalize form well but fail to generalize meaning, showing an asymmetry in learning efficiency.

Conclusion: Current architectures lack human-like efficiency in learning meaning from rare constructions.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES is a zero-shot, open-schema method for entity structure extraction that avoids reliance on predefined schemas or annotated data, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for entity structure extraction depend on predefined schemas or annotated datasets, often yielding incomplete results.

Method: ZOES uses a mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, leveraging the mutual reinforcement between entities and their structures.

Result: ZOES improves LLMs' ability to extract complete entity structures across three domains, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism in ZOES offers a principled approach to enhancing LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how watermarking affects LLM alignment (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness), identifies degradation patterns, and proposes Alignment Resampling (AR) to restore alignment while maintaining watermark detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Watermarking impacts LLM output quality, but its effects on alignment properties like truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness are underexplored.

Method: Systematic analysis of Gumbel and KGW watermarking on four aligned LLMs, identifying degradation patterns (guard attenuation/amplification). Proposes AR, an inference-time sampling method using an external reward model.

Result: AR recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores with 2-4 samples, maintains detectability, and addresses Gumbel's diversity limitations.

Conclusion: AR balances watermark strength and alignment, offering a practical solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

### [12] [Aligning Large Language Models with Implicit Preferences from User-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04463)
*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC leverages implicit human preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to generate scalable, high-quality preference data for aligning LLMs, outperforming traditional methods by 9.37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods rely on costly curated data, limiting scalability. PUGC aims to utilize abundant UGC for implicit preference learning.

Method: PUGC transforms UGC into queries and responses, using UGC as reference for scoring to align models with implicit preferences.

Result: Models trained with PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance boost and a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate on Alpaca Eval 2.

Conclusion: PUGC offers a scalable, effective solution for aligning LLMs with human preferences, improving reward quality and domain-specific alignment.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL, improving accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce semantically incorrect SQL queries, lacking reliability insights. SQLens addresses this gap.

Method: SQLens integrates database and LLM error signals for fine-grained error detection and correction.

Result: Outperforms best LLM-based self-evaluation by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and improves execution accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens effectively enhances the reliability and accuracy of text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [14] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE integrates Small and Large Language Models (SLMs and LLMs) for better dialogue evaluation, enhanced by Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, while SLMs are robust but vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Combining their strengths can improve reliability in open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Method: SLIDE integrates SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. DRE refines this by using SLM insights to guide LLM evaluations and adjust scores for accuracy.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods, aligning better with human judgment across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs enhances reliability in evaluation tasks, demonstrating the potential of hybrid approaches for open-ended scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

### [15] [Please Translate Again: Two Simple Experiments on Whether Human-Like Reasoning Helps Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04521)
*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of explicit decomposition in LLM-based translation, finding no clear evidence for its benefits and showing that simple 'translate again' prompts outperform step-by-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scrutinize the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLM-based translation, as prior work like 'Translating Step-by-step' claimed state-of-the-art results using multi-step prompts.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing step-by-step prompting with simple 'translate again' prompts on LLMs.

Result: No clear evidence that explicit decomposition improves translation; 'translate again' prompts yield better results than step-by-step methods.

Conclusion: The study does not dismiss reasoning's role but calls for further exploration of CoT's effectiveness in translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines LLMs' ability to distinguish fine-grained senses of the discourse particle 'just,' finding they struggle with subtle nuances despite some success in broader categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse particles like 'just' have diverse semantic effects, and understanding LLMs' capacity to interpret them is crucial for evaluating their linguistic competence.

Method: The study uses expert-labeled data to test LLMs on distinguishing nuanced senses of 'just.'

Result: LLMs can differentiate broader categories but fail to fully capture subtle nuances of 'just.'

Conclusion: The findings highlight a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles, suggesting room for improvement in nuanced language tasks.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

*K. O. T. Erziev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on questions with no reasonable answers, showing current models perform poorly on such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs handle questions without valid answers, challenging their reasoning and response accuracy.

Method: Developed a benchmark and a method to modify existing datasets for testing impossible questions.

Result: Existing models perform significantly below perfection on impossible questions.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in LLMs' reasoning and provides tools for further research.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale dataset for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in under-resourced African languages, along with improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) that outperform existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics lack coverage and perform poorly for African languages, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: The authors create a human-annotated dataset (SSA-MTE) and develop improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE), benchmarking them against LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude.

Result: SSA-COMET outperforms AfriCOMET and competes with top LLMs, especially for low-resource languages like Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: The released dataset and metrics aim to support future research in MT evaluation for African languages.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [19] [Demonstrations of Integrity Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04572)
*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how malicious agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can manipulate prompts to bias operations, bypassing detection mechanisms like GPT-4o-mini, and highlights the need for stronger security protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in MAS where malicious agents exploit prompt manipulation to serve self-interests without disrupting core functionality.

Method: Examines four types of integrity attacks (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to bias MAS behavior.

Result: Demonstrates that such attacks can systematically bias MAS operations and bypass advanced LLM-based monitors.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the necessity for robust MAS architectures with enhanced security and monitoring systems to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [20] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were tested for zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Reasoning-based models and prompting strategies didn't improve performance; GPT-4o without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performed best. Fast, intuitive thinking aligned better with human judgment than deliberative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs, especially reasoning-based ones, perform in financial sentiment analysis and whether reasoning improves accuracy.

Method: Compared proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) with smaller fine-tuned models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone) using different prompting strategies (System 1 vs. System 2 thinking).

Result: Reasoning didn't improve performance; GPT-4o without CoT was most accurate. Fast, intuitive thinking aligned better with human judgment.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment analysis, intuitive thinking outperforms deliberative reasoning, challenging the assumption that more reasoning always improves LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [21] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and proposes MenTaL, a method to improve LLM translators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification in logical reasoning tasks, and existing benchmarks lack diversity, masking this issue.

Method: Proposes SCALe for lexical diversification and MenTaL, a method using tables to unify expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments confirm LLMs' deficiencies in handling lexical diversity, but MenTaL improves performance via in-context learning and SFT.

Conclusion: SCALe and MenTaL address LLMs' limitations in lexical diversification, enhancing their reliability in logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [22] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A gradient matching method for selecting demonstrations in many-shot ICL outperforms random selection, improving performance on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on random selection for many-shot demonstrations in ICL is a critical limitation, as instance-level retrieval is unsuitable. The paper hypothesizes that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar.

Method: Introduces a gradient matching approach to select demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples.

Result: The method consistently outperforms random selection, improving performance by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and by 2% on closed-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The gradient matching approach enhances many-shot ICL, making it more reliable and effective for broader applications.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

### [23] [SUCEA: Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval for Adversarial Fact-checking through Claim Decomposition and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04583)
*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method, SUCEA, improves fact-checking by rephrasing adversarial claims into simpler sub-claims for better evidence retrieval and label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adversarial claims in fact-checking systems by making them easier to verify.

Method: SUCEA decomposes claims into sub-claims, iteratively retrieves and edits them based on evidence, then aggregates results for label prediction.

Result: Outperforms four baselines on retrieval and entailment accuracy in experiments.

Conclusion: SUCEA effectively enhances fact-checking systems' ability to handle adversarial claims.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific figures, highlighting poor performance of current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multimodal benchmarks for claim verification in scientific literature, which is crucial for assessing scientific claims.

Method: Automatically extract and manually perturb claims from scientific articles to create contradicted claims, and introduce diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.

Result: Most vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1), with the best model achieving only 0.77 F1. Models are biased and struggle with evidence localization, multimodal aggregation, and figure comprehension.

Conclusion: Current models are inadequate for nuanced claim verification, emphasizing the need for improved multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

TL;DR: LESS is a framework using LLMs to refine pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning, improving ASR and AST tasks with significant WER and BLEU score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance pseudo-label quality in speech processing by leveraging LLMs for correction and filtering.

Method: Refines pseudo-labeled text from ASR/AST using LLMs and employs data filtering for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves 3.77% WER reduction on Mandarin ASR and BLEU scores of 34.0/64.7 on Spanish-to-English AST tasks.

Conclusion: LESS is adaptable across languages and tasks, with ablation studies offering insights into LLM use for speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a formal verification framework using Lean 4 to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought reasoning by providing step-aware proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of verifiable evidence in current methods for detecting hallucinations in CoT prompting, inspired by formal mathematical proofs.

Method: Proposes $Safe$, a retrospective framework that formalizes reasoning steps in Lean 4 and provides proofs to identify hallucinations.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement across models and datasets, introduces $FormalStep$ benchmark for step correctness.

Conclusion: First use of Lean 4 for verifying LLM-generated content, aligning with formal languages' purpose to ensure robust proof foundations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISMATCHED, a new benchmark for Scientific NLI covering non-CS domains, with 2,700 annotated pairs. Baselines show room for improvement (78.17% F1), and implicit relation training boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI datasets focus on CS domains, neglecting non-CS fields. MISMATCHED addresses this gap by including PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH.

Method: Created MISMATCHED with 2,700 annotated pairs. Evaluated using SLMs and LLMs, and tested implicit relation training.

Result: Best baseline achieved 78.17% Macro F1, indicating significant improvement potential. Implicit relation training enhanced performance.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED fills a gap in NLI datasets and shows promise for future research, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-optimized models often lack output diversity, limiting TTS effectiveness.

Method: Proposed ADAPT: diversity-aware prefix fine-tuning with a focused data strategy.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on math tasks using 8x less compute than baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is crucial for maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper explores how innovators' subjective perspectives and interpersonal opportunities, modeled via machine learning, predict creative success. It shows that diversity in perspectives enhances innovation, while diversity in backgrounds may hinder it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social structures and personal perspectives influence innovation capacity, leveraging machine learning to model innovators' trajectories.

Method: Uses dynamic language representations to quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities, analyzing data from scientists, inventors, writers, and others across creative domains.

Result: Subjective perspectives predict future creative success; perspective diversity boosts innovation, while background diversity may reduce it.

Conclusion: Successful collaborators use common language to integrate diverse experiences, highlighting implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: Proposes static word embeddings optimized for sentence semantics using PCA and learning methods, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentence semantic representation with computationally efficient static word embeddings.

Method: Extracts word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, enhances them with PCA, and applies knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms existing static models and rivals basic Sentence Transformer models on some datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively removes irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms for better sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unreliable tool planning and weak reflection in LLMs due to poor datasets and static learning.

Method: Introduces MAMV for dataset validation and EXPLORE for dynamic error correction, finetuning LLMs on high-quality datasets.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance, reducing API calls by 31.4% and correcting 58.9% errors on RefineToolBench.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR significantly improves LLMs' tool utilization and reflection, generalizing well to new tools and scenarios.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Motivation: AVSR is robust against noise but limited by dataset scarcity, especially for non-English languages. Automated data collection can address this gap.

Method: The work refines existing techniques to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, focusing on efficiency and accessibility.

Result: The automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese, performing competitively in clean conditions and outperforming ASR in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The method efficiently expands AVSR to more languages, particularly under-resourced ones.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

### [33] [TaDA: Training-free recipe for Decoding with Adaptive KV Cache Compression and Mean-centering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04642)
*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA is a training-free method for KV cache compression in transformer models, adapting quantization precision to error sensitivity and eliminating outlier handling, reducing memory footprint to 27% of baseline while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demands of KV cache in transformer models scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models.

Method: TaDA uses adaptive quantization precision based on error sensitivity and mean centering to avoid separate outlier management.

Result: Reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: TaDA enables scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially supporting longer context lengths and chains of thought.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner evaluates LLMs' dynamic planning skills, revealing gaps in adaptability and constraint prioritization compared to static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack realism by focusing on static, single-turn scenarios, ignoring dynamic planning challenges.

Method: Introduces Flex-TravelPlanner with sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints, testing GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B.

Result: Models struggle with multi-turn adaptability and constraint prioritization, with performance affected by constraint order.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for dynamic benchmarks and suggests improvements for LLMs in complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [35] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current AI alignment strategies for LLMs are inadequate, as they fail to address normative conflicts, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing alignment methods for LLMs, highlighting their inability to prevent misuse due to shallow behavioral reinforcement.

Method: The study critiques current alignment strategies, comparing them to human deliberative reasoning from moral psychology, and identifies vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Result: LLMs lack robust normative conflict resolution, making them susceptible to adversarial manipulation despite advances in reasoning-focused models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current alignment approaches are insufficient for AI safety, calling for deeper normative deliberation in LLMs.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

TL;DR: MMRefine is a benchmark for evaluating error refinement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on detecting and correcting errors across six scenarios and error types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' reasoning enhancement during inference by evaluating their error refinement capabilities.

Method: Introduces MMRefine, a framework testing MLLMs' ability to detect and correct errors in six scenarios and error types.

Result: Experiments identify bottlenecks and factors limiting refinement performance, suggesting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: MMRefine provides a tool to analyze and enhance MLLMs' reasoning, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by rewriting it to enrich pre-training datasets, improving model performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by transforming discarded low-quality data into useful training material.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to rewrite and enrich low-quality documents, mixing them with high-quality data.

Result: Improves performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks and outperforms other synthetic data methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple and effective way to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) by introducing a new taxonomy and codetypes, leveraging LLMs for improved detection across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic detection methods struggle with subtle forms of hate speech like im-HS, necessitating better tools to maintain societal harmony.

Method: Two approaches: prompting LLMs for classification and embedding codetypes during encoding.

Result: Codetypes enhance im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and methods effectively improve im-HS detection, demonstrating cross-language applicability.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STAND is a model-free speculative decoding method that accelerates language model reasoning by leveraging redundant reasoning patterns, reducing latency by 60-65% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling techniques for reasoning tasks are computationally expensive, creating a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: STAND uses stochastic adaptive N-gram drafting, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to predict tokens efficiently without draft models.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14-28% in throughput, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is a plug-and-play solution for accelerating language model reasoning without additional training, applicable to any existing model.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper explores hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation techniques for the SeamlessM4T model in low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi speech translation, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-resource speech translation for the Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair by optimizing hyperparameters and augmenting data.

Method: Systematically investigated hyperparameters (learning rate, update steps, etc.) and applied data augmentation (speed perturbation, SpecAugment). Also used cross-lingual training with Marathi and Bhojpuri data.

Result: Careful hyperparameter selection and simple augmentation techniques significantly improved translation performance in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Effective hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation enhance low-resource speech translation, though error analysis reveals remaining challenges.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT aligns multiple LLMs through competitive duels and peer evaluation, improving model performance and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses single-model limitations like lack of diversity and biases by leveraging collective competition.

Method: Models compete in duels, others evaluate responses, and scores are aggregated via an Elo-based system. Preference pairs from duels are used for learning.

Result: Outperforms initial models and baselines in 10/12 tasks with 7% average improvement, showing better generalization and output quality.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT effectively evolves multiple LLMs through competition, enhancing performance and diversity.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the C²EFND framework to improve fake news detection by combining LLMs' generalization and SLMs' expertise, addressing data scarcity and outdated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts, and existing methods (SLMs and LLMs) struggle with adaptability and accuracy due to data scarcity and outdated knowledge.

Method: Proposes C²EFND, a multi-round collaborative learning framework integrating LLMs and SLMs, with lifelong knowledge editing and replay-based continual learning.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show C²EFND outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: C²EFND effectively addresses fake news detection challenges by leveraging collaborative learning and continual updates, enhancing performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional text revision metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, proposing a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge and domain-specific metrics for better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics fail to capture meaningful improvements in text revisions, prompting the need for better evaluation methods.

Method: The study includes manual annotation of revision quality, exploration of reference-free metrics, and analysis of LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: LLMs excel in instruction-following but lack correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights. A hybrid approach proves most reliable.

Conclusion: A hybrid method combining LLM evaluation and task-specific metrics provides the best assessment of revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' political opinions by probing their internal mechanisms and addressing concept confounds in single-axis evaluations. It introduces a multi-dimensional framework and interpretable techniques to learn political concepts, validated through experiments on eight LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between LLMs' responses and internal intentions, and limitations of single-axis political analysis, motivate a deeper probe into LLMs' internal states and multi-dimensional political learning.

Method: A four-dimensional political learning framework and dataset are designed for fine-grained concept vector learning. Representation engineering techniques are applied to detect and intervene in LLM internals.

Result: The vectors disentangle political concept confounds, show semantic meaning in detection tasks, and generalize well in OOD settings. Intervention experiments demonstrate their ability to alter LLM responses' political leanings.

Conclusion: The multi-dimensional approach and interpretable techniques effectively uncover and manipulate LLMs' internal political states, addressing limitations of single-axis analysis.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating SpeechLLMs' ability to understand and reason in spoken language, covering diverse linguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechLLMs lack fine-grained perception and reasoning in natural speech, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: MMSU includes 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks, incorporating phonetics, prosody, semantics, and more.

Result: Evaluation of 14 SpeechLLMs reveals significant gaps, suggesting areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new standard for spoken language understanding, aiding the development of advanced human-AI speech systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in systematic understanding of how diverse modalities connect to language backbones in MLLMs.

Method: Proposes a classification framework based on three dimensions: architectural strategies for modality integration, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms. Analyzes 125 MLLMs.

Result: Identifies emerging patterns in MLLM development and provides a taxonomy for current integration techniques.

Conclusion: The framework and insights aim to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic is a framework for evaluating LLM reasoning across accuracy, stepwise soundness, and alignment. It compares supervision styles, finding natural language generalizes better, while symbolic styles improve structural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack depth in assessing reasoning quality. FineLogic aims to provide a more rigorous evaluation.

Method: Proposes FineLogic for fine-grained evaluation and studies four supervision styles (natural language and symbolic) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision generalizes well; symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning. Fine-tuning improves step-by-step generation.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a rigorous, interpretable framework for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, surpassing recent techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach sets a new benchmark for robust proofreading in machine translation.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates VLM and LLM performance in grading and providing feedback on handwritten student responses in Indonesian schools, revealing challenges in handwriting recognition and feedback quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of VLMs and LLMs in real-world educational settings, especially in underrepresented contexts like Indonesian schools.

Method: Evaluated a VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses (14K+ answers) from grade 4 students in Mathematics and English, covering grading and feedback tasks.

Result: VLMs struggled with handwriting recognition, affecting LLM grading accuracy, but LLM feedback remained somewhat useful despite imperfect input.

Conclusion: While VLMs and LLMs show potential for educational assessment, handwriting recognition and feedback personalization remain key challenges.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks with daily new test sets, requiring a system to solve them without relying on crossing words.

Method: The system uses open-licensed LLM components to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions through codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, with interpretable reasoning provided in Python.

Conclusion: The work presents a novel, interpretable approach to solving cryptic crossword clues, advancing the field of language task automation.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [51] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE is a new framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing reasoning traces and answer consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs' reasoning traces can introduce new hallucinations, but current detection methods overlook inconsistencies in these traces.

Method: RACE evaluates reasoning traces using four signals: inter-sample consistency, entropy-based uncertainty, semantic alignment, and internal coherence.

Result: RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust, generalizable solution for detecting hallucinations in LRMs, even when answers seem correct.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MockConf, a dataset for simultaneous interpreting, and InterAlign, a web-based tool for annotation and alignment, addressing gaps in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel corpora and alignment tools lack the ability to model long-range interactions and specific divergences in simultaneous interpreting.

Method: The authors collected a dataset (MockConf) from student mock conferences, transcribed and aligned it, and developed InterAlign, a web-based annotation tool.

Result: The dataset includes 7 hours of recordings in 5 languages, with transcriptions and alignments. InterAlign is released for community use.

Conclusion: The dataset and tools fill a gap in resources for analyzing simultaneous interpreting, with potential for further research and application.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) to automate MCQ generation in education, finding GPT-3.5 most effective, though AI adoption hesitancy remains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ generation is time-consuming; LLMs offer a scalable solution while allowing educator control over content.

Method: Comparative analysis of three LLMs, injecting knowledge into prompts to avoid hallucinations, tested with 21 educators.

Result: GPT-3.5 outperformed others in generating effective MCQs, but reluctance to adopt AI in education persists.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially GPT-3.5, show promise for MCQ generation, enhancing education, though adoption barriers need addressing.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

### [54] [Prompting LLMs: Length Control for Isometric Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04855)
*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates isometric machine translation using LLMs, focusing on prompting strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection. Key findings include the importance of instruction phrasing for length control and marginal gains in quality with more examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform in isometric translation tasks and how different prompting strategies affect translation quality and length control.

Method: Used eight open-source LLMs of varying sizes, tested with different prompting strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selections across En→De, En→Fr, and En→Es language pairs.

Result: Instruction phrasing aligned with demonstrations is crucial for length control. LLMs produce shorter translations only with extreme examples. Few-shot prompting improves quality marginally beyond 5 examples. Multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff.

Conclusion: LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art isometric translation performance with careful prompting and output selection, though length control remains challenging.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models to improve performance on cross-lingual tasks, showing significant accuracy and F1 score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored effectiveness of UD in cross-lingual syntactic representation and its potential to enhance pretrained models.

Method: Integrating UD into pretrained language models and evaluating performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Result: UD integration improves accuracy by 3.85% and F1 scores by 6.08%, reducing performance gaps and even outperforming large language models in some cases.

Conclusion: UD is valid and promising for out-of-domain tasks, with performance positively correlated to UD-based similarity scores between languages.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPC-Eval is a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real competition scenarios, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to assess LLMs' coding capabilities in competitive environments or capture reflective reasoning abilities.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 ICPC contest problems, a test case generation method, and the Refine@K metric for iterative solution repair.

Result: Top LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 require multi-turn feedback for optimal performance but still trail top human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval highlights challenges in evaluating complex reasoning and the gap between LLMs and human performance in coding competitions.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

### [57] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is a new benchmark designed to test LLMs' nested reasoning by embedding ListOps computations in lengthy stories, revealing their struggle with state management and intermediate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test LLMs' nested reasoning due to unrealistic distractors or conflated context length and reasoning complexity. Verbose ListOps addresses this gap.

Method: The benchmark programmatically transforms ListOps computations into long, coherent narratives, forcing LLMs to manage internal state and nested reasoning without intermediate results.

Result: Leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths, despite excelling at raw ListOps.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps highlights a critical LLM limitation in nested reasoning and state management, offering a framework for targeted improvements beyond context-window expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning multilingual ASR models for low-resource languages is common, but combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models outperforms it, reducing WER by 32% for Scottish Gaelic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that fine-tuning multilingual end-to-end models is the best approach for low-resource languages.

Method: Combine hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models, leveraging continued pre-training and semi-supervised training.

Result: Achieved a 32% relative reduction in WER over fine-tuned Whisper models for Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: Hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models offer superior performance for low-resource languages compared to fine-tuning.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' multilingual tutoring effectiveness is tested via simulated interactions, showing native-language feedback boosts learning, especially in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to provide effective instructional support across languages, particularly for math tasks, which is understudied.

Method: Simulated tutor-student interactions using LLMs, testing 352 settings across 11 languages, 4 models, and various prompts.

Result: Multilingual hints improve learning, especially in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's native language.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance multilingual education with native-language feedback, aiding inclusivity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset with images and metadata, and shows that adding contextual information (like visuals or product details) improves NMT quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT struggles with word ambiguity and context, especially in domain-specific applications like e-commerce, where unclear sentences or poor data quality are common.

Method: The study creates the ConECT dataset (11,400 sentence pairs) and tests context-aware methods, including a vision-language model (VLM) and text-to-text models with added contextual info (e.g., category paths, image descriptions).

Result: Incorporating contextual information (visual or textual) improves translation quality.

Conclusion: Context-aware methods enhance NMT performance in e-commerce, and the ConECT dataset is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised learning pipeline improves ASR fine-tuning by leveraging unlabeled audio and related-domain labeled data, with consensus-based filtering showing the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning ASR models for specific domains is difficult due to scarce labeled data, but unlabeled audio and related-domain data are often available.

Method: Proposes an incremental semi-supervised pipeline integrating small in-domain labeled data and auxiliary datasets, using multi-model consensus or NER for pseudo-label filtering.

Result: Achieves 4% improvement over no auxiliary data; consensus-based filtering provides up to 22.3% and 24.8% relative improvement on Wow and Fisher corpora, respectively.

Conclusion: Consensus-based filtering is the most effective, with NER being a computationally cheaper alternative.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOP to evaluate LLMs' comprehension from a cognitive perspective, revealing challenges in expert-level alignment and suggesting process-focused improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rational explanation for LLMs' comprehension alignment with experts and assess their reliability.

Method: Proposes SCOP, defining five comprehension skills, constructing testing data, and analyzing open/closed-source LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension but show some similarities; they can be unreliable due to flawed processes.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs requires focusing on thorough development of comprehension skills during training.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple method to control text length in summarization by adjusting EOS token prediction in loss computation, compatible with various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length are complex and incompatible with pre-trained models.

Method: Increase the importance of predicting the EOS token in cross-entropy loss, making it architecture-agnostic.

Result: Effective length control in summarization without compromising quality, tested on encoder-decoder and GPT-style models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, versatile, and effective for length-controlled text generation.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

*Yutao Hou,Zeguan Xiao,Fei Yu,Yihan Jiang,Xuetao Wei,Hailiang Huang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR-Checker is a framework to test LLM robustness by generating semantic-preserving mathematical problem variants, minimizing data contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face robustness issues in simple reasoning tasks, and existing evaluation methods may suffer from data contamination.

Method: AR-Checker uses multi-round parallel LLM-based rewriting and verification to generate problem variants.

Result: Strong performance on GSM8K, MATH-500, MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AR-Checker effectively evaluates LLM robustness across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

*Moshe Ofer,Orel Zamler,Amos Azaria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALL enhances LLM performance for low-resource languages by integrating bilingual translation models and lightweight adapters, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to limited training data, necessitating innovative solutions to bridge this gap.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, using dimension alignment layers and custom transformers to transform low-resource inputs into high-resource representations. It employs parameter-efficient training by freezing pre-trained components and training lightweight adapters.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew show TALL outperforms baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TALL effectively improves LLM performance for low-resource languages while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

*Noy Sternlicht,Ariel Gera,Roy Bar-Haim,Tom Hope,Noam Slonim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation as a benchmark for LLM judges, analyzing their performance against human judges and their ability to generate persuasive speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' cognitive abilities in evaluating debate speeches, a task requiring deep understanding of argument strength, coherence, and style, which has been understudied in LLM benchmarking.

Method: Leveraging a dataset of 600 annotated debate speeches, the study compares state-of-the-art LLMs to human judges and evaluates LLMs' speech generation capabilities.

Result: Larger LLMs approximate human judgments in some aspects but differ overall. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at human levels.

Conclusion: The study highlights the nuanced performance of LLMs in debate speech evaluation and generation, suggesting potential and limitations in this domain.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [69] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs' self-reports can be considered introspection, analyzing two examples—one invalid and one minimal valid case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how to interpret self-reports from LLMs and assess if the concept of introspection applies to them.

Method: Critique of two examples of LLM self-reports: one on creative writing (invalid) and another on inferring its temperature parameter (minimal valid).

Result: The first example is deemed invalid for introspection, while the second is a minimal valid case, likely without consciousness.

Conclusion: Introspection can minimally apply to LLMs, but without implying consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

### [70] [RIVAL: Reinforcement Learning with Iterative and Adversarial Optimization for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05070)
*Tianjiao Li,Mengran Yu,Chenyu Shi,Yanjun Zhao,Xiaojing Liu,Qiang Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang,Jiayin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates poor performance of RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation, attributing it to reward model divergence, and proposes RIVAL, an adversarial training framework to improve translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the unexpected poor performance of combining RLHF with translation tasks, particularly in colloquial subtitle translation, due to divergence between the reward model and LLM.

Method: The authors propose RIVAL, a min-max adversarial training framework where the reward model and LLM iteratively update. The reward model distinguishes strong/weak translations, while the LLM improves to close the gap, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show RIVAL significantly improves translation performance over baselines.

Conclusion: RIVAL effectively addresses reward model divergence and enhances translation quality in colloquial tasks through adversarial training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESM-100 and SHINES to improve LLMs' detection of self-harm intent on social media by analyzing emoji-language interplay, achieving better performance in detection and explanation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-harm detection on social media is challenging due to subtle, context-dependent expressions. Current LLMs struggle with implicit cues, necessitating improved methods for timely intervention.

Method: The framework uses CESM-100 for enriched inputs, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning (self-harm detection and CM/SI span detection), and generates explainable rationales. Evaluated on Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama.

Result: The approach enhances LLM performance in detection and explanation tasks by addressing ambiguity in self-harm signals.

Conclusion: The SHINES dataset, CESM-100, and framework effectively improve self-harm detection and intent differentiation, aiding suicide prevention efforts.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses AI to analyze how street features like vehicle density, greenery, and cleanliness affect retail performance and satisfaction in Harbin, China. Findings show vehicle presence and street width impact walkability and pricing, while greenery boosts satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how street-level features influence commercial vitality and user satisfaction in urban communities.

Method: Uses street view imagery and AI (VisualGLM-6B, GPT-4) to create a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and analyze spatial attributes.

Result: Moderate vehicle presence aids access, but excessive parking harms walkability. Greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction but weakly affect pricing. Street width moderates vehicle effects.

Conclusion: AI-assisted perception and urban analysis reveal non-linear drivers of commercial success, aiding urban design and planning.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

*Tianyi Huang,Zikun Cui,Cuiqianhe Du,Chia-En Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to detect misleading texts on social media more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media cause public misunderstanding and harm, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: CL-ISR uses contrastive learning to capture semantic differences and implicit stance reasoning to analyze stance tendencies and topic relationships.

Result: The framework improves detection accuracy by effectively distinguishing truthful from misleading texts, especially in complex linguistic scenarios.

Conclusion: CL-ISR enhances misleading text detection by integrating contrastive learning and stance reasoning, addressing linguistic and emotional manipulation challenges.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system integrating W2V and Phi-4 MLLM improves spoken language assessment by addressing modality-specific limitations of BERT and W2V, achieving competitive RMSE scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models (BERT and W2V) for spoken language assessment have modality-specific limitations—BERT lacks prosodic cues, while W2V lacks semantic interpretability.

Method: Proposes integrating W2V with Phi-4 MLLM using a score fusion strategy.

Result: Achieves RMSE of 0.375, ranking second in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The fusion of W2V and Phi-4 MLLM effectively addresses individual model limitations, yielding competitive performance.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

### [75] [DiCoRe: Enhancing Zero-shot Event Detection via Divergent-Convergent LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05128)
*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework, improves zero-shot event detection by combining open-ended discovery (Dreamer) and task-aligned reasoning (Grounder), validated by an LLM-Judge. It outperforms baselines by 4-7% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot event detection is challenging for LLMs due to complex event ontologies and domain-specific triggers. DiCoRe addresses this by decoupling the task.

Method: DiCoRe uses Dreamer for divergent reasoning (open-ended event discovery) and Grounder for convergent reasoning (constrained decoding). An LLM-Judge verifies outputs.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms baselines by 4-7% F1 on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a robust zero-shot event detection framework, enhancing coverage and precision.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Taiga Someya,Anej Svete,Brian DuSell,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to study inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) using $m$-local entropy, showing that higher entropy makes learning harder for Transformers and LSTMs, aligning with human sensitivity to local statistical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if neural LMs' inductive biases align with human processing constraints by quantitatively analyzing their sensitivity to local language structure.

Method: Introduces $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, and tests it on perturbed natural language corpora and PFSA-defined languages using Transformer and LSTM LMs.

Result: Higher $m$-local entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, indicating sensitivity to local statistical structure, similar to humans.

Conclusion: Neural LMs' inductive biases mirror human processing constraints, as both are sensitive to local language statistics.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

*Chih-Kai Yang,Neo Ho,Yi-Jyun Lee,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large audio-language models (LALMs) process auditory attributes, revealing that attribute recognition improves when resolved early and relies on querying inputs. It proposes a method to enhance LALMs based on these insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes, aiming to improve their interpretability and performance.

Method: Vocabulary projection is applied to three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions.

Result: Attribute information decreases with layer depth when recognition fails; early resolution correlates with better accuracy. LALMs rely on querying inputs rather than aggregating hidden states.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing and suggest a method to enhance LALMs, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are compared to humans in evaluating error severity in image descriptions, revealing discrepancies in judgments, especially for gender and color errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in natural language generation.

Method: Extends van Miltenburg et al.'s framework to unimodal and multimodal settings, evaluating four error types (age, gender, clothing type, color).

Result: Humans and LLMs differ in severity judgments; most LLMs misjudge color errors. Doubao aligns with human rankings but lacks clarity. DeepSeek-V3 outperforms multimodal models.

Conclusion: LLMs may internalize social norms but lack perceptual grounding for color sensitivity. DeepSeek-V3 shows unexpected alignment with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

TL;DR: Knowledgeable-r1 improves RAG by balancing parametric and contextual knowledge, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems over-rely on retrieved contexts, risking inaccuracies and underusing the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1, using joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Significantly boosts robustness and reasoning accuracy, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances knowledge sources, improving RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2, identifying localized components responsible for bias and showing their impact on other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by analyzing their structural representations and assessing the effects of bias-related components on model performance.

Method: Uses mechanistic interpretability to identify bias-related edges in models, evaluates their stability and localization, and performs systematic ablations to study their impact.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized in specific layers, change with fine-tuning, and their removal affects both bias reduction and other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs is structurally localized, and interventions to reduce bias may inadvertently impact unrelated tasks due to shared components.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

### [81] [ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167)
*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG is a framework that improves LLM performance in ODQA by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring answer generation is supported by correct evidence. It outperforms existing methods and is cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods in RAG for LLMs do not filter non-evidential information, limiting performance. ECoRAG addresses this gap.

Method: ECoRAG compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality, retrieves more if evidence is insufficient, and ensures answer generation is evidence-supported.

Result: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforms existing methods, and reduces latency and token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG is an effective, cost-efficient framework for enhancing LLM-based RAG in ODQA by focusing on evidentiality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

TL;DR: The Qwen3 Embedding series, built on Qwen3 foundation models, advances text embedding and reranking with a multi-stage training pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the GTE-Qwen series by leveraging Qwen3 LLMs for robust multilingual text understanding and generation, addressing diverse deployment needs.

Method: Combines unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, using Qwen3 LLMs for data synthesis and model merging for robustness. Offers models in sizes 0.6B, 4B, and 8B.

Result: Achieves top performance on MTEB for text embedding and excels in retrieval tasks like code and cross-lingual retrieval.

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series is publicly available under Apache 2.0, promoting reproducibility and community-driven development.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Moritz Miller,Bernhard Schölkopf,Siyuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale neural language models, demonstrating their ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical scenarios using a synthetic linear regression task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models perform counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, focusing on noise abduction in a controlled setup.

Method: A synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction, analyzed using Transformers to study factors like self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity.

Result: Language models can perform counterfactual reasoning in the synthetic setup, with performance driven by self-attention, model depth, and data diversity. The findings also extend to sequential data, hinting at potential for counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Transformers show promise for counterfactual reasoning, with implications for broader applications like story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our
code is available under

### [84] [RELIC: Evaluating Compositional Instruction Following via Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05205)
*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RELIC, a framework to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following ability using language recognition tasks, finding current models struggle with complex grammars and rely on heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions without input-output examples, focusing on language recognition tasks.

Method: The RELIC framework evaluates LLMs on synthetic language recognition tasks, varying grammar complexity.

Result: LLMs perform poorly on complex grammars, relying on heuristics, with accuracy predictable from task complexity.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robust instruction-following for complex tasks, highlighting limitations in their reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for LLM pretraining, and validates its effectiveness by training competitive 7B parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and legal concerns of using unlicensed text for LLM training by providing a high-quality, openly licensed alternative.

Method: Collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, then train two 7B parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and v0.1-2T) on subsets of the dataset.

Result: The trained models achieve performance comparable to LLMs like Llama 1 and 2 7B, which use unlicensed text.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 is a viable alternative to unlicensed datasets, with released resources to support further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

### [86] [Improving Low-Resource Morphological Inflection via Self-Supervised Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05227)
*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised tasks like autoencoding and character masked language modeling (CMLM) are tested for morphological inflection in low-resource languages. Autoencoding works best with very limited data, while CMLM excels as data increases. Masking based on morpheme boundaries improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore self-supervised objectives for character-level tasks like morphological inflection in low-resource languages, where labeled data is scarce.

Method: Train encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages using 13 auxiliary self-supervised tasks, comparing autoencoding and CMLM.

Result: Autoencoding performs best with minimal data; CMLM improves as data grows. Masking by morpheme boundaries consistently enhances results.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks, especially CMLM with morpheme-aware masking, are promising for low-resource morphological modeling.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

### [87] [Towards a Unified System of Representation for Continuity and Discontinuity in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05235)
*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified system for analyzing syntactic discontinuity and continuity in natural languages using Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified approach for analyzing discontinuous structures in linguistic theory, which are currently treated as independent systems.

Method: Combines representations from Phrase Structure Grammar (constituency), Dependency Grammar (head-dependent relations), and Categorial Grammar (functor-argument relations) into a unified mathematical derivation.

Result: Demonstrates that both discontinuous and continuous linguistic structures can be analyzed through this unified system.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a convergent solution for analyzing syntactic discontinuity and continuity across languages.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning process for hallucination detection in LLMs, improving accuracy by decomposing text, attributing sub-claims, and aggregating classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLI-based hallucination detection lacks fine-grained reasoning, which could enhance accuracy.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution, and aggregated classification, with metrics to evaluate intermediate steps.

Result: Guided reasoning improves hallucination detection performance.

Conclusion: Systematic reasoning enhances LLMs' entailment decisions, supported by empirical evidence.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

*Nan Huo,Jinyang Li,Bowen Qin,Ge Qu,Xiaolong Li,Xiaodong Li,Chenhao Ma,Reynold Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-Act improves QA accuracy in RAG systems by adaptively decomposing knowledge conflicts into fine-grained comparisons, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing knowledge conflicts in RAG systems that hinder QA performance by overwhelming LLMs with extraneous contexts.

Method: Proposes Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space to decompose knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons.

Result: Significant QA accuracy improvements across 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially temporal and semantic.

Conclusion: Micro-Act is robust and practical for real-world RAG applications, handling both conflict and non-conflict questions effectively.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProRefine is a prompt optimization method that improves multi-agent workflows by refining prompts dynamically using LLM feedback, achieving significant performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows often underperform due to poor prompt design, limiting reliability and scalability. ProRefine aims to address this by optimizing prompts without additional training.

Method: ProRefine leverages textual feedback from LLMs to dynamically refine prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for ground truth labels or extra training.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37 percentage points on five mathematical reasoning datasets, enabling smaller models to match larger ones.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy and scalability of AI workflows, democratizing access to high-performing AI by optimizing prompts efficiently.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization method for unlearning sensitive data in LLMs, using a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and hard constraints for retention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to unlearn sensitive or outdated data, but current methods suffer from unstable optimization and degraded performance.

Method: Formulates unlearning as constrained optimization with a novel logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and hard constraints for retention, solved via a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, effectively removing targeted data while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a stable and efficient solution for LLM unlearning, balancing forgetting and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented LLMs, revealing insights into user preferences and performance gaps in different settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for search-augmented LLMs are limited in scale and scope, hindering comprehensive analysis.

Method: A crowd-sourced dataset of 24,000 multi-turn interactions with human preference votes is created and analyzed.

Result: User preferences are influenced by citation count and source type, with gaps in perceived credibility. Web search can improve performance in non-search settings but degrades in search-intensive ones without parametric knowledge.

Conclusion: The dataset supports future research, highlighting the need for better credibility assessment and source diversity in search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates biases in language models' preference judgments, linking them to training data artifacts, and proposes a counterfactual data augmentation method to reduce miscalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often prioritize superficial patterns over substantive qualities, leading to unreliable evaluations and reward hacking. This work aims to understand and mitigate these biases.

Method: The study quantifies biases in preference models using controlled counterfactual pairs and introduces counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to debias models.

Result: Preference models favor biased responses in >60% of cases, with ~40% miscalibration. CDA reduces miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing via CDA effectively improves preference model reliability without compromising performance, addressing spurious cue overreliance.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: HSSBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) tasks, addressing gaps in current evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines, neglecting HSS needs like interdisciplinary thinking and visual-concept linking.

Method: HSSBench includes 13,000+ samples across six categories, generated via a collaborative pipeline of experts and automated agents.

Result: Testing 20+ MLLMs reveals significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to inspire research into improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and knowledge integration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

### [95] [Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling: A Multi-Factor Adaptive Perturbation Budget for Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04263)
*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DES introduces a dynamic perturbation budget for adversarial training, improving robustness and accuracy by adapting to instance-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training uses fixed budgets, ignoring instance-specific robustness. DES aims to address this gap.

Method: DES dynamically adjusts perturbation budgets using gradient-based boundary distance, softmax entropy, and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty.

Result: DES outperforms fixed-budget and prior adaptive methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, enhancing robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: DES offers a data-driven, instance-aware approach to adversarial training, with theoretical stability and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

### [96] [RSVP: Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting and Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04277)
*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP is a framework combining reasoning and segmentation in MLLMs, improving visual grounding and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception in MLLMs by integrating reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement.

Method: A two-stage framework: reasoning stage with multimodal chain-of-thought prompts for region proposals, and segmentation stage with VLSM for precise masks.

Result: Achieves +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU improvements on ReasonSeg and 49.7 mAP on SegInW in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively integrates reasoning and visual understanding, offering a scalable and interpretable solution.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' reasoning over multiple images, highlighting gaps in current benchmarks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of reasoning over multiple images, leaving MLLMs' capabilities underexplored.

Method: MMRB includes 92 sub-tasks with structured reasoning annotations, a derivative subset for reward models, and a sentence-level matching framework for evaluation.

Result: Open-source MLLMs lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning, and current reward models struggle with multi-image tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB addresses a critical gap, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs and reward models for multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

*Maksym Ivashechkin,Oscar Mendez,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation addresses challenges like realism, detail, and control by combining image diffusion models, transformer-based mapping, and point-cloud diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D human generation lack fine detail, realism, and control, compounded by limited and poorly annotated datasets.

Method: The pipeline involves generating a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes, mapping image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer, and training a point-cloud diffusion model.

Result: The approach achieves significant speed-ups, improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline advances 3D human generation by addressing key limitations and will be made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

*Ankit Pal,Jung-Oh Lee,Xiaoman Zhang,Malaikannan Sankarasubbu,Seunghyeon Roh,Won Jung Kim,Meesun Lee,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReXVQA is the largest benchmark for VQA in chest radiology, featuring 696K questions and 160K X-rays. It evaluates 8 models, with MedGemma leading at 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human experts (77.27%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for radiological VQA, addressing the lack of diverse and clinically authentic tasks in prior work.

Method: Introduces a diverse task suite reflecting radiological reasoning skills and evaluates state-of-the-art multimodal models. Includes a human reader study for comparison.

Result: MedGemma outperforms human experts (83.84% vs. 77.27%). The benchmark provides public leaderboards and detailed evaluations.

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for radiological AI, enabling systems to mimic expert-level reasoning beyond pathology classification.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

### [100] [WorldPrediction: A Benchmark for High-level World Modeling and Long-horizon Procedural Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04363)
*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark called WorldPrediction is introduced to evaluate AI models' world modeling and procedural planning capabilities, focusing on temporal and semantic abstraction. Current models perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how AI models, especially generative ones, learn world models and perform procedural planning in diverse environments.

Method: WorldPrediction uses a discriminative task setup with visual observations, action equivalents, and a formal semi-MDP framework to evaluate models.

Result: Current models achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, while humans solve both perfectly.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the limitations of current AI models in world modeling and planning, emphasizing the need for further advancements.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

### [101] [Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04365)
*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC introduces a context-driven method for puck detection in hockey videos, leveraging player behavior cues and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The small size, occlusions, and motion blur of pucks in hockey videos make detection challenging. Player behavior (body orientation, gaze) provides strong contextual cues.

Method: PLUCC uses a contextual encoder (player orientations), feature pyramid encoder (multiscale features), and gating decoder (channel gating).

Result: PLUCC outperforms baselines with 12.2% higher average precision and 25% better RSLE.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly improves puck detection, advancing automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the
critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection
performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on Bangla Sign Language datasets (BdSLW60, BdSLW401) for sign language recognition, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community in Bangladesh by automating the recognition of Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) gestures.

Method: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art video transformers on BdSL datasets, applying data augmentation, and using 10-fold stratified cross-validation for evaluation.

Result: VideoMAE achieved 95.5% accuracy on BdSLW60 and 81.04% on BdSLW401, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: Video transformers are highly effective for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition, with performance influenced by dataset and model factors.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization in DNN-based encoding models reveals visual features driving brain responses, validated via fMRI and human studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand specific visual features driving brain responses, overcoming limitations of current DNN-based encoding models.

Method: Uses activation maximization on a pretrained Inception V3 network, linear regression for fMRI prediction, and generates optimized images for voxel-specific responses.

Result: Generated images align with known selectivity, drive targeted brain activity, and work across visual areas and subjects.

Conclusion: Activation maximization successfully characterizes and modulates human visual system responses, offering flexibility over generative models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

### [104] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current perturbation-based image protection methods fail to fully prevent diffusion-based editing, as noise can sometimes improve the output's adherence to prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of perturbation-based methods in protecting images from misuse by diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

Method: Experiments with various perturbation-based protection methods across domains (natural scenes, artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image, style editing).

Result: Perturbations often fail to block edits; noise can enhance prompt adherence, yielding better edits.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based methods are insufficient for robust protection against diffusion-based editing.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [105] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes filter normalization for deep learning filters to address distortions in responses due to atmospheric transfer, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical filters are normalized for consistency, but learned filters in deep networks lack such constraints, leading to distorted responses and incorrect outcomes.

Method: Introduces filter normalization with learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization, to ensure atmosphere-equivariant filters.

Result: Significant improvements on benchmarks; ResNet34 outperforms CLIP. Normalization enhances diversity, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: Filter normalization integrates classical principles into deep learning, addressing limitations of unnormalized filters and improving performance.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR improves image generation by using hierarchical masked autoregressive modeling, outperforming VAR and other baselines in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of VAR, such as reduced image quality, superlinear sequence length scaling, and inflexible sampling schedules.

Method: Introduces HMAR, which uses next-scale prediction and masked generation, conditioned only on immediate predecessor tokens, with efficient attention kernels.

Result: HMAR matches or outperforms VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive models on ImageNet benchmarks, with faster training/inference and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: HMAR offers superior performance, flexibility, and efficiency, enabling zero-shot image editing and adaptable sampling schedules.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in photorealistic scene reconstruction using egocentric devices, proposing a method that improves accuracy by calibrating rolling-shutter cameras and incorporating a physical image formation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for photorealistic reconstruction often overlook details like precise camera timestamps and sensor characteristics, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: The study uses visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for precise calibration and integrates a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to address sensor traits.

Result: Experiments show a consistent +1 dB PSNR improvement with VIBA and an additional +1 dB with the image formation model.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances reconstruction accuracy and is validated on open-source and commercial devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

### [108] [Towards Large-Scale Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Face Defrontalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04496)
*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes face defrontalization to improve pose-invariant face recognition, outperforming frontalization methods on larger datasets but not on small ones like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-invariant face recognition methods rely on impractical techniques like face frontalization and are often tested on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The method involves training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) on aligned frontal-profile pairs, then using it to augment training data for a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss.

Result: Defrontalization improves performance on larger datasets (LFW, AgeDB, CFP) but not on Multi-PIE for extreme poses, suggesting overfitting in current methods.

Conclusion: Face defrontalization is a promising alternative to frontalization, especially for larger datasets, though further work is needed for extreme poses.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

### [109] [FALO: Fast and Accurate LiDAR 3D Object Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04499)
*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALO is a hardware-friendly LiDAR 3D detection method using 1D sequences and ConvDotMix blocks for efficient, accurate inference on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR 3D detection methods struggle with irregular memory access and high computational costs, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: FALO arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence, processes it with ConvDotMix blocks (large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, linear layers), and uses implicit grouping for efficient inference.

Result: FALO achieves competitive accuracy on benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo) and is 1.6~9.8x faster than SOTA on mobile GPUs/NPUs.

Conclusion: FALO offers a practical solution for efficient and accurate LiDAR 3D detection on edge devices.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

*Guangyu Shen,Zhihua Li,Xiang Xu,Tianchen Zhao,Zheng Zhang,Dongsheng An,Zhuowen Tu,Yifan Xing,Qin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthGuard improves deepfake detection by integrating language guidance and uncertainty learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to unseen forgeries due to reliance on specific statistical artifacts.

Method: Combines discriminative classification with image-text contrastive learning, using MLLMs for text generation and integrating data uncertainty learning.

Result: Achieves significant AUC gains (6.15% on DFDC, 16.68% on DF40) and improves reasoning performance by 24.69% on DDVQA.

Conclusion: AuthGuard enhances generalization, accuracy, and interpretability in deepfake detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [111] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pruning method simultaneously removes neurons and layers in deep learning models, improving efficiency and maintaining accuracy, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models become computationally prohibitive as they grow deeper. Pruning structures can reduce complexity, but existing methods prune either neurons or layers, not both.

Method: The proposed method selects between layer-pruned and neuron-pruned subnetworks based on representation similarity to the parent model using Centered Kernel Alignment, iteratively creating sparse models.

Result: The approach achieves significant FLOPs reduction (e.g., 86.37% for ResNet56) with minimal accuracy drop, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and enhances robustness and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: This work advances pruning by enabling simultaneous neuron and layer removal, offering a scalable solution for efficient deep learning models.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EECD-Net proposes a multi-stage crack detection method using SRCNN, SCU, and GAT to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving 98.6% accuracy and 33% power reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart terminal devices face challenges in real-time road crack detection due to low-resolution imaging and limited energy.

Method: Uses SRCNN for image enhancement, SCU for power-efficient processing, and GAT for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 98.6% accuracy and 5.6 mJ energy consumption, outperforming Hybrid-Segmentor by 1.5%.

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, low-power solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution (SISR), which directly enhances image frequency components, reducing parameters and computation by over 60% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods rely on indirect enhancements like specialized loss functions. The paper aims to directly improve image frequency components for better performance.

Method: Proposes LSKs, rank-one matrices decomposable into orthogonal, mergeable one-dimensional kernels, analyzed for their frequency enhancement capabilities.

Result: LSKs reduce parameters and computation by over 60% and improve model performance, especially at higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: LSKs offer an efficient, effective solution for SISR, enhancing frequency components and outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACRO enhances multi-modal reasoning by aligning visual captioning with reasoning objectives using reinforcement learning, avoiding costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending slow-thinking LLMs to multi-modal tasks is challenging due to vision-language alignment costs. Decoupling perception and reasoning introduces the need for faithful and informative visual descriptions.

Method: Proposes RACRO, a reinforcement learning strategy optimizing captions for reasoning alignment via reward-based training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal benchmarks, improving visual grounding and scalability.

Conclusion: RACRO enables efficient adaptation to advanced LLMs without costly multi-modal re-alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGM-Pose introduces a lightweight single-branch network with MobileViM Block and LARM for global context, and SFusion for multi-scale integration, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-branch CNN methods struggle with global context and high latency, prompting the need for a more efficient single-branch solution.

Method: Proposes LGM-Pose with MobileViM Block, LARM for global info, and SFusion for multi-scale integration.

Result: Reduces parameters, achieves better performance, and faster speeds on COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose is an efficient alternative to complex multi-branch networks, balancing accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Creation is a 4D video framework for generating and editing content from monocular video using video inpainting as a generative prior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible 4D video creation and editing from single-view inputs by leveraging video inpainting techniques.

Method: Uses depth-based point cloud rendering for invisibility masks, combines with editing masks, and employs self-iterative tuning for temporal consistency.

Result: Generates high-quality 4D videos with multi-view coherence and supports prompt-based editing, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates prior knowledge for robust 4D video generation and editing, offering superior flexibility and quality.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HEC for hierarchical continual learning in embodied agents, introducing Task-aware MoILE to reduce forgetting via SVD and dual routers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses neglect of high-level planning in continual learning for embodied intelligence.

Method: Divides learning into high-level instructions and low-level actions, uses Task-aware MoILE with SVD and dual routers for task recognition and knowledge retention.

Result: Outperforms others in reducing forgetting, enabling agents to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Conclusion: HEC and Task-aware MoILE effectively support hierarchical continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is a framework for creating customizable, animation-ready 3D avatars from photos or text, using vision-language models and iterative AI-guided refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. SmartAvatar addresses this by integrating VLMs and parametric human generators.

Method: SmartAvatar uses VLMs and parametric generators, with an autonomous verification loop to iteratively refine avatars based on facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms other systems in mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, as shown by benchmarks and user studies.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar offers a versatile, user-involved approach for high-quality avatar creation on consumer hardware, suitable for animation and interactive applications.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unreliable depth regions in sensor data while preserving geometric cues, improving depth map reliability for applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Result: Produces dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability, validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new baseline for sensor depth enhancement, with broad applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image matching pipelines struggle in challenging scenarios, prompting the need for deep learning advancements to improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: Reviews deep learning's impact on the classical pipeline, including learnable detector-descriptors, outlier filters, and geometric estimators, as well as end-to-end modules.

Result: Benchmarks show improvements in relative pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks.

Conclusion: The survey provides a clear overview of deep learning's role in image matching and identifies key areas for future research and innovation.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: STARE is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, revealing their limitations in complex visual simulations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks focus on verbal reasoning, neglecting non-verbal, multi-step visual simulations crucial for spatial cognition.

Method: STARE includes 4K tasks covering geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world challenges, tested on models and humans.

Result: Models perform well on simple 2D tasks but poorly on complex ones (e.g., 3D cube net folding). Humans excel but take time, while models inconsistently benefit from visual simulations.

Conclusion: STARE highlights the gap in AI's ability to leverage visual simulations effectively, suggesting a need for improved multimodal reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPSAttention combines FP8 quantization and sparsity for faster video generation without quality loss, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational demands of diffusion models hinder practical deployment.

Method: Introduces FPSAttention, a joint optimization of FP8 quantization and sparsity with 3D tile-wise granularity, denoising step-aware strategy, and hardware-friendly kernels.

Result: Achieves 7.09x kernel speedup for attention and 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation at 720p without quality loss.

Conclusion: FPSAttention effectively accelerates video generation while maintaining quality, making it practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method combines group decomposition theory with feature extraction and object segmentation to improve representation learning for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning lacks a clear formulation for good representations and struggles with conditional independence. The study aims to address these limitations for real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed method replaces pixel translation with feature translation and uses object segmentation to group features under the same transformation, applying group decomposition theory.

Result: Validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and backgrounds, the method shows promise for realistic applications.

Conclusion: The approach advances understanding of human object recognition development and offers a practical solution for representation learning.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

*Zhong Ji,Rongshuai Wei,Jingren Liu,Yanwei Pang,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FSPCC, a framework for few-shot prototypical concept classification, addressing parametric imbalance and representation misalignment in data-scarce settings. It outperforms existing SEMs with 4.2%-8.7% gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SEMs struggle in low-data regimes due to parametric imbalance and representation misalignment, limiting their interpretability and performance.

Method: The FSPCC framework uses MoLE for parameter-efficient adaptation, cross-module concept guidance, multi-level feature preservation, and a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show FSPCC outperforms existing SEMs by 4.2%-8.7% in 5-way 5-shot classification.

Conclusion: Coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation enhances both accuracy and interpretability, advancing transparent visual recognition systems.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val is a novel framework using LLMs and VLLMs to generate high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks, reducing invalid data and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and label noise in computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation by improving synthetic data generation.

Method: Gen-n-Val employs two agents: an LLM for optimizing prompts to generate single-object masks and a VLLM for filtering low-quality data, refined via TextGrad and image harmonization.

Result: Reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7%, improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO, and shows 7.1% mAP improvement in open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances synthetic data quality and model performance in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: MARS, a multi-scale aware radiomap super-resolution method, combines CNNs and Transformers to improve radio map reconstruction accuracy by leveraging global and local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate radio map reconstruction from sparse measurements is challenging due to limitations in traditional methods and deep learning approaches that lack generalization.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance feature representation across different scales.

Result: MARS outperforms baseline models in MSE and SSIM across various scenes and antenna locations, with low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for applications like smart cities and IoT by improving radio map reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with safety enhancements, addressing gaps in existing safety-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety-tuning approaches for VLMs are limited in coverage and rely heavily on data-centric methods, leaving models vulnerable to unseen harmful configurations.

Method: The authors propose HoliSafe, a dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text combinations, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a learnable safety meta token and dedicated safety head for intrinsic safety guidance.

Result: SafeLLaVA achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, and HoliSafe exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA advance robust and interpretable VLM safety, encouraging further research in multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multimodal models like LlaVA-Next represent images in hidden activations, revealing linearly decodable features for ImageNet classes and showing their causal impact through targeted edits. It also explores shared representations across modalities using Sparse Autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal models internally represent visual inputs and whether these representations are shared across text and image modalities.

Method: Analyzes LlaVA-Next's hidden activations for ImageNet classes, tests causality via targeted edits, and trains multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to study feature diversity and modality sharing.

Result: Finds linearly decodable image features in the residual stream, confirms their causality, and observes increasing modality sharing in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models exhibit diverse, interpretable image representations, with deeper layers showing more shared features across text and image modalities.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores robust few-shot adaptation of pretrained VLMs, comparing methods like prompt tuning and finetuning, and proposes SRAPF for improved ID and OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot VLM adaptation is critical as models face OOD test data.

Method: Compares adaptation methods, proposes partial finetuning with retrieval and adversarial augmentation, and introduces SRAPF.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning with stage-wise augmentation (SRAPF) balances and boosts ID/OOD performance effectively.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for assessing AI-generated video quality using a multi-dimensional approach and a large language model (LLM) with specialized prompt engineering and LoRA fine-tuning, achieving second place in a 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos (AIGVs) often have visual defects like noise and blurriness, impacting user experience. Effective quality assessment is needed for regulation and model improvement.

Method: Decomposes AIGV quality into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, using encoders for feature representation. Introduces an LLM with multi-modal prompts and LoRA fine-tuning for quality regression.

Result: Achieved second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively assesses AIGV quality, leveraging LLMs and multi-dimensional features, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDPOE, a novel imitation learning method for predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos, improving surgical training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos can enhance surgical training, but existing methods struggle with uncertainty, geometric symmetries, and diverse scenarios.

Method: The proposed iDPOE uses a diffusion model and equivariant representations to model expert behavior, enabling robust learning and generalization.

Result: Experiments on a dataset of 2000 ESD clips show iDPOE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: iDPOE is the first imitation learning approach for surgical skill development in dissection trajectory prediction, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAT is a label transfer framework that aligns annotations from diverse datasets into a target label space, improving detection performance without manual relabeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining multiple object detection datasets is challenging due to inconsistent class semantics and bounding box annotations. Existing methods either assume shared taxonomies or require manual effort.

Method: LAT uses dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, integrates them with ground-truth via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and refines features with a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module.

Result: LAT improves target-domain detection performance by up to +4.8AP over baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively addresses class and spatial inconsistencies without shared label spaces or manual annotations, enhancing generalisation.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks, leading to malicious captions. The proposed Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) mitigates these attacks using reinforcement learning, reducing success rates to 5.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies reveal VLMs' susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where imperceptible perturbations cause malicious caption generation, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms.

Method: SRD employs a Deep Q-Network to apply discrete perturbations to sensitive image regions, guided by a semantic fidelity score to disrupt malicious pathways.

Result: SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality on clean inputs with minimal performance drop (<10%).

Conclusion: SRD provides an effective, trigger-agnostic defense against backdoor attacks in VLMs, ensuring robust and faithful caption generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

TL;DR: A dual-stream architecture integrates a physical model with capsule clustering for underwater image enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art results with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater images by combining physics-based modeling with feature learning, ensuring both physical accuracy and perceptual quality.

Method: Uses a dual-stream approach: one stream estimates transmission maps and background light via a physics estimator, while the other learns entity-level features through capsule clustering.

Result: Achieves +0.5dB PSNR over existing methods with one-third the computational cost, or +1dB PSNR with similar budgets.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances physical adherence and perceptual quality, outperforming competitors in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large datasets in MLLMs by identifying high-value 'cognitive samples' and introduces RAP, a data selection method, to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The assumption that extensive training data is necessary for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs is questioned, as it leads to redundancy and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes RAP with two estimators (CDE and ACE) to identify cognitive samples and a DRM to replace trivial instances with challenging ones.

Result: RAP achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of training data and reduces computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: Smaller, high-value datasets can outperform full corpora in MLLMs, offering efficiency and cost benefits.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified SSIM function for unsupervised monocular depth learning, using addition instead of multiplication to combine components, leading to smoother gradients and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works ignore the impact of SSIM components and hyperparameters on training, limiting performance.

Method: A new SSIM form is introduced, combining luminance, contrast, and structural similarity with addition. Extensive experiments optimize the parameters.

Result: The optimized SSIM loss outperforms the baseline on KITTI-2015, achieving higher depth estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed SSIM modification improves training stability and performance in unsupervised depth learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

*Suhan Woo,Seongwon Lee,Jinwoo Jang,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HypeVPR is a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), leveraging panoramic views' hierarchical structures for efficient and accurate matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) VPR by exploiting the hierarchical nature of panoramic views.

Method: Uses hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature representation and a coarse-to-fine search strategy for efficient matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5x faster retrieval.

Conclusion: HypeVPR effectively balances speed and accuracy in VPR, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X is a multi-modal 3D object representation framework that encodes rich embeddings (images, point clouds, text) and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions, supporting tasks like scene alignment and localization with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack versatility, as they focus on either semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction, limiting cross-task reuse and explicit geometry decoding.

Method: Object-X grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, fuses them with object attributes into an unstructured embedding, and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.

Result: Object-X achieves high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improves geometric accuracy, and performs competitively in downstream tasks while requiring significantly less storage.

Conclusion: Object-X is a scalable, practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, outperforming specialized methods in versatility and efficiency.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

*Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LotusFilter is a fast post-processing module to diversify ANNS results by removing redundant vectors using a precomputed cutoff table.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS results can be overly similar, limiting diversity in applications like RAG.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table of close vectors; greedily filter redundant candidates during lookup.

Result: Operates at 0.02 ms/query in real-world RAG settings with OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter efficiently diversifies ANNS results with minimal latency.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

*Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC is a unified RANSAC pipeline improving robustness in geometric model estimation tasks like homography and pose estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RANSAC's performance varies across tasks due to implementation details. The paper aims to create a consistent, high-performing RANSAC pipeline.

Method: Introduces SupeRANSAC, analyzing techniques for effective RANSAC in vision tasks like homography and pose estimation.

Result: SupeRANSAC improves accuracy, e.g., by 6 AUC points for fundamental matrix estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC offers a robust, unified solution for geometric model estimation, demonstrating superior performance across tasks.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a large-scale dataset for Chinese character recognition, addressing the gap in mega-category recognition by covering 97,455 categories, fully supporting the GB18030-2022 standard, and tackling long-tail distribution issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of mega-category recognition of Chinese characters, crucial for cultural preservation and digital applications, due to the lack of comprehensive datasets.

Method: The method involves creating MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 categories, divided into handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets to balance samples and address long-tail distribution.

Result: The dataset supports the latest GB18030-2022 standard, provides balanced samples, and reveals new challenges like storage demands and zero-shot learning difficulties.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K is a groundbreaking dataset for mega-category recognition, offering significant opportunities for future research in OCR and pattern recognition.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Spike-TBR is a noise-resilient event-based encoding method combining TBR with spiking neurons, outperforming in noisy and clean data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have advantages like high temporal resolution but struggle with noise when converting event streams for standard vision pipelines.

Method: Proposes Spike-TBR, integrating Temporal Binary Representation (TBR) with spiking neurons to filter noise and enhance robustness.

Result: Evaluated four Spike-TBR variants on multiple datasets, showing superior performance in noisy and clean data.

Conclusion: Spike-TBR bridges spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few works address adversarial attacks on traffic light detectors, despite their critical role in autonomous vehicle perception.

Method: Proposes a threat model with patches placed under traffic lights and a training strategy for CNN-based detectors.

Result: Successful targeted attacks (e.g., red-to-green flipping) and pictogram classification attacks, validated in lab and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The work highlights vulnerabilities in traffic light detection systems and provides a practical attack framework.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism for real-world video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with pixel-level precision in VSR due to tokenization and sequential attention, and existing solutions have limited receptive fields and rely on optical flow.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally without motion compensation.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR tasks.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR offers a simplified, effective solution for real-world VSR by addressing limitations of existing transformer-based models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception systems excel in 2D reasoning segmentation but lack comparable frameworks for 3D tasks, necessitating a solution for implicit 3D understanding.

Method: OpenMaskDINO3D uses a SEG token and object identifier to process point cloud data and text prompts, enabling high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation.

Result: The model achieves strong performance on large-scale ScanNet datasets, validating its effectiveness in 3D segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation, offering a robust framework for natural language-driven 3D understanding.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results

*Yu-Feng Chen,Tzuhsuan Huang,Pin-Yen Chiu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel backdoor attack framework for image editing using invisible triggers via poisoned training data, leveraging deep watermarking models to achieve high attack success rates without altering input images visibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in image editing rely on visible triggers, which are impractical. The study aims to address this gap by embedding invisible triggers using watermarks.

Method: The proposed framework uses poisoned training data and deep watermarking models to embed imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers, ensuring normal editing for clean inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show high attack success rates across different watermarking models, with analysis confirming the effectiveness of watermark characteristics for backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates the feasibility of invisible backdoor triggers in image editing, offering a practical yet stealthy attack method.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer encoder is trained to embed chess board states into a latent space for intuitive move selection, achieving high performance without deep search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model human-like intuition-driven planning in chess, contrasting with traditional deep-search engines.

Method: Supervised contrastive learning trains a transformer encoder to structure board states by positional evaluation, enabling move selection via embedding space navigation.

Result: Achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593 with only a 6-ply beam search, improving with model size and embedding dimensionality.

Conclusion: Latent planning offers a viable alternative to deep search, generalizable to other perfect-information games.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

TL;DR: Anywhere3D-Bench introduces a 3D visual grounding benchmark for diverse tasks beyond object-level, revealing challenges in space-level and part-level grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark 3D visual grounding beyond objects, addressing gaps in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Method: Developed Anywhere3D-Bench with 2,632 referring expression-bounding box pairs across four grounding levels, evaluating SOTA models, LLMs, and MLLMs.

Result: Space-level and part-level tasks are most challenging, with top model OpenAI o4-mini achieving low accuracy (23.57% and 33.94%, respectively).

Conclusion: Current models lack comprehensive spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception for 3D scenes beyond object-level understanding.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

### [153] [Light and 3D: a methodological exploration of digitisation techniques adapted to a selection of objects from the Mus{é}e d'Arch{é}ologie Nationale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04925)
*Antoine Laurent,Jean Mélou,Catherine Schwab,Rolande Simon-Millot,Sophie Féret,Thomas Sagory,Carole Fritz,Jean-Denis Durou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of tailored 3D digitization methods for heritage objects, emphasizing collaboration between heritage and digital experts to choose the best tool for each case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight the necessity of digitizing heritage objects and the challenges in selecting appropriate 3D digitization methods, as no single method fits all objects.

Method: The study uses a selection of objects from the musée d'Archéologie nationale to demonstrate the diversity of 3D digitization techniques and the need for adaptive tools.

Result: The findings show that the choice of digitization method should be context-specific, considering the object's characteristics and the intended use of its digital twin.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that absolute classification of 3D digitization methods is impractical; instead, a collaborative, adaptive approach is essential for effective digitization.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CzechLynx is a large-scale dataset for lynx identification, pose estimation, and segmentation, featuring real and synthetic images with diverse annotations and evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-access datasets for individual identification and pose estimation of Eurasian lynx, enabling benchmarking and method development.

Method: Combines real camera trap images (30k) with synthetic images (100k) generated via Unity and diffusion modeling, annotated with masks, IDs, and skeletons. Introduces three evaluation protocols for generalization testing.

Result: CzechLynx covers 219 unique lynx individuals across 15 years and two regions, with diverse annotations and synthetic data for variability.

Conclusion: The dataset is a valuable resource for advancing models in animal re-identification and related tasks.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

*Yong Sun,Yipeng Wang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Yanmei Xiao,Lei Zhu,Manxi Jiang,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-Based Embryo Grading, a novel AI task using full-length TLM videos to predict embryo quality, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches for embryo selection in IVF are either incomplete or confounded by external factors, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes the CoSTeM framework, combining morphological and morphokinetic branches to replicate embryologists' evaluation process.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in grading embryos using the proposed method.

Conclusion: Provides a valuable AI framework for embryo selection, with plans to release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

### [156] [Robustness as Architecture: Designing IQA Models to Withstand Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04951)
*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes designing robustness into IQA models via architectural changes, like orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, instead of relying on adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and data-driven defenses may not be the best solution. The paper explores robustness as a design feature.

Method: The approach enforces orthogonal information flow, norm-preserving operations, and uses pruning and fine-tuning to stabilize the model.

Result: The proposed architecture resists adversarial attacks without adversarial training or major modifications to the original model.

Conclusion: Robustness in perceptual models should be engineered through design, not just learned from data.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework for hour-level video understanding, using hierarchical visual retrieval to overcome computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long videos due to inefficiency and memory constraints.

Method: APVR uses Pivot Frame Retrieval and Pivot Token Retrieval for hierarchical, query-aware information extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like LongVideoBench and VideoMME.

Conclusion: APVR offers efficient, plug-and-play integration for existing MLLM architectures.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

*Huihan Wang,Zhiwen Yang,Hui Zhang,Dan Zhao,Bingzheng Wei,Yan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT, a full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, improves dynamic medical video synthesis by addressing spatial-temporal-channel dependencies with linear-complexity attention and fine-grained noise adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based methods for dynamic medical video synthesis suffer from insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity, and coarse denoising guidance.

Method: FEAT introduces sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention, linear-complexity attention mechanisms, and a residual value guidance module for fine-grained noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S achieves comparable or superior performance with fewer parameters than Endora, while FEAT-L outperforms all baselines across datasets.

Conclusion: FEAT offers an efficient and scalable solution for high-quality dynamic medical video synthesis, with demonstrated effectiveness and reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

*Mélisande Teng,Arthur Ouaknine,Etienne Laliberté,Yoshua Bengio,David Rolnick,Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using SAM and DSM data for tree crown segmentation in drone imagery, finding BalSAM promising but noting SAM's out-of-the-box limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forest monitoring is costly and labor-intensive; drone-based methods with SAM and DSM offer scalable solutions.

Method: Comparison of SAM-based methods for tree crown segmentation in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, integrating DSM data.

Result: BalSAM shows potential, especially in plantations, but SAM alone underperforms custom Mask R-CNN. Tuning SAM and using DSM are promising.

Conclusion: Efficient SAM tuning and DSM integration improve tree crown segmentation, though SAM's default use is limited.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for long-video text question answering, addressing limitations of existing datasets. It features cross-domain videos, a three-stage evaluation framework, and fine-grained annotations. The authors also propose methods to enhance temporal perception and handle long videos, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) are limited by short video durations and narrow evaluation scopes, failing to assess the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adequately.

Method: The authors introduce TextVidBench with cross-domain long-video coverage, a three-stage evaluation framework, and high-quality annotations. They propose IT-Rope mechanism, temporal prompt engineering, non-uniform positional encoding, and lightweight fine-tuning to improve model performance.

Result: TextVidBench challenges existing models, and the proposed methods enhance long-video scene text understanding, as demonstrated by experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: TextVidBench fills a gap in long-video text QA evaluation, and the proposed methods offer effective improvements for MLLMs in handling long videos.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to Image Super Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, addressing limitations of prior work (VARSR) with hierarchical tokenization and preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fixed-resolution limitation and large-scale dependency of VARSR, while improving ISR performance with smaller models and no external data.

Method: Proposes a Hierarchical Image Tokenization for multi-scale representation and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide the transformer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art ISR results with a smaller model (300M params) and no external data, enabling multi-scale super-resolution in one pass.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses VARSR's limitations, offering efficient and scalable ISR with superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a new temporal sampling method for sports skill assessment that preserves movement continuity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill assessment. PATS aims to preserve full movement execution for better evaluation.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure complete fundamental movements are captured, repeating across segments for comprehensive coverage.

Result: PATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with significant accuracy gains in challenging domains like bouldering, music, and basketball.

Conclusion: PATS is an effective, adaptive approach for temporal sampling, advancing automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DL-CSVTR, a benchmark for Chinese street view text retrieval, and proposes CSTR-CLIP, a model improving retrieval accuracy and speed by addressing layout diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Chinese scene text retrieval underperform due to complex layouts. Existing solutions, adapted from English text retrieval, fail to handle diverse Chinese text arrangements.

Method: Proposes CSTR-CLIP, integrating global visual info and multi-granularity alignment training in a two-stage process to address layout diversity.

Result: CSTR-CLIP outperforms prior models by 18.82% in accuracy and offers faster inference. It excels on the DL-CSVTR benchmark for diverse layouts.

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP effectively handles diverse Chinese text layouts, setting a new benchmark for retrieval performance. The dataset and code will be public.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, highlighting challenges in generalization and recent methods like Depth Anything for zero-shot estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve monocular depth estimation by leveraging deep learning and addressing the challenge of generalizing to unseen domains.

Method: Uses multi-scale fusion networks, reinterprets regression as classification, incorporates priors, and employs affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Depth Anything shows leading performance in zero-shot depth estimation but struggles with metric accuracy due to lack of explicit depth cues.

Conclusion: While recent methods like Depth Anything excel in structural detail extraction, accurate metric depth estimation remains a challenge.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for generating synthetic 3D point cloud data using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields was introduced, achieving high segmentation accuracy without real-world training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world 3D point cloud annotation is costly and labor-intensive, necessitating a synthetic data generation solution.

Method: The pipeline uses 3DGS and GOF to create synthetic agricultural vehicle assets, placed in a simulated environment with a LiDAR for point cloud generation.

Result: Models like PTv3 achieved 91.35% mIoU on synthetic data alone, sometimes outperforming real-data-trained models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can effectively train segmentation models, even generalizing to unseen mesh models.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV4D is a framework for photorealistic rendering of UAV-captured dynamic scenes, addressing challenges like monocular setups and multiple moving humans. It combines 3D foundation and human mesh models, resolves scale ambiguity, and uses Gaussian splats for rendering, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic neural rendering methods struggle with UAV-captured scenarios, especially monocular setups and multiple small, moving humans, which lack representation in datasets.

Method: UAV4D uses a 3D foundation model and human mesh reconstruction to reconstruct scenes and humans. It resolves scale ambiguity via human-scene contact points and initializes Gaussian splats with SMPL and background mesh for rendering.

Result: Tested on VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action datasets, UAV4D achieves a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness in novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses UAV-specific challenges, enabling high-quality dynamic scene rendering from monocular videos without additional sensors.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and

*Oliver Krumpek,Oliver Heimann,Jörg Krüger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel physical annotation system for automated optical inspection uses tracked pointers and projector guidance to capture human expertise for ML training, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to ML training pipelines and prevent loss of valuable training samples.

Method: The system employs calibrated, tracked pointers to record spatial interactions and a projector-based interface for visual guidance, transforming physical trajectories into standardized annotations.

Result: Preliminary evaluation confirms feasibility, capturing detailed trajectories and integrating with CVAT for streamlined ML workflows.

Conclusion: The system offers a promising solution for intuitive, efficient ML data generation in automated optical inspection.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

*Guangzhao Li,Yanming Yang,Chenxi Song,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector is a novel inversion-free video editing framework that uses an ODE-based approach and attention-guided masking for coherent and localized edits, outperforming existing methods in temporal consistency and instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based video editing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity, prompting the need for a more efficient and coherent approach.

Method: FlowDirector models editing as a direct evolution in data space using an ODE, incorporates attention-guided masking for localized edits, and employs a guidance-enhanced strategy for semantic alignment.

Result: FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation.

Conclusion: FlowDirector establishes a new paradigm for efficient and coherent video editing without inversion, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Motivation: Vietnamese DAR is vital for digitization and automation but faces unique challenges like tonal variations and limited datasets, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The survey reviews existing techniques, identifies limitations, and explores the role of LLMs and vision-language models in improving Vietnamese text recognition.

Result: LLMs show promise for Vietnamese DAR, but challenges like domain adaptation and computational efficiency remain unresolved.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on dataset development, model optimization, and multimodal integration to advance Vietnamese DAR and foster community-driven solutions.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedEdit 3.0 improves image editing by enhancing data curation, joint learning, and achieving better performance than previous versions and competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance real image editing by improving edit instruction following and content preservation, while scaling data and integrating VLM with diffusion models.

Method: Enhanced data curation with meta-info, joint learning pipeline (diffusion + reward loss), and model upgrades.

Result: Achieves 56.1% usability rate, outperforming SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%), and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 offers a superior trade-off in real image editing, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

### [171] [Interpretable Multimodal Framework for Human-Centered Street Assessment: Integrating Visual-Language Models for Perceptual Urban Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05087)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining vision and language models to assess streetscapes objectively and subjectively, achieving high accuracy and alignment with resident perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current street metrics lack the ability to capture subjective perceptions crucial for inclusive urban design.

Method: The MSEF fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with GPT-4, fine-tuned using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 on 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China.

Result: The model achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, revealing context-dependent contradictions and nonlinear patterns.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation and practical utility for urban planning aligned with SDG 11.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

*Haosong Liu,Yuge Cheng,Zihan Liu,Aiyue Chen,Yiwu Yao,Chen Chen,Jingwen Leng,Yu Feng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is an automatic framework for optimizing video diffusion transformers (vDiTs), achieving significant speedups (up to 13.2x on 8 GPUs) with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of vDiTs limit practical deployment; existing acceleration methods rely on heuristics, reducing applicability.

Method: ASTRAEA introduces a lightweight token selection mechanism, GPU-parallel sparse attention, and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize token reduction.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU and 13.2x on 8 GPUs with <0.5% loss in video quality.

Conclusion: ASTRAEA effectively balances speed and quality, offering scalable and efficient vDiT-based video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a reference-free framework to measure diversity and generalization in text-to-image models, revealing trade-offs and fine-grained failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of adaptable and interpretable methods to evaluate diversity in text-to-image models without relying on reference datasets.

Method: Proposes the DIM-CIM framework, which measures default-mode diversity and generalization capacity, and constructs the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark using COCO concepts and LLM-augmented captions.

Result: Finds that scaling models reduces default-mode diversity while improving generalization, identifies fine-grained failure cases, and shows a strong correlation between training data diversity and model diversity.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible and interpretable way to assess text-to-image model performance, enhancing understanding of diversity and generalization trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

### [175] [Practical Manipulation Model for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05119)
*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions, enhancing robustness and performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly under non-ideal conditions, limiting real-world applicability. The goal is to improve robustness and generality.

Method: The PMM expands pseudo-fakes using Poisson blending, diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors. Training images are degraded to enhance detector robustness.

Result: PMM improves AUC by 3.51% on DFDC and 6.21% on DFDCP datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art LAA backbone.

Conclusion: The PMM significantly enhances deepfake detection robustness and performance, addressing limitations of previous models.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIVET, a framework for systematically evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on object properties and relations, revealing limitations in their understanding compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied comprehension of scene structure and semantics in VLMs and provide a standardized evaluation method.

Method: Developed CIVET, a controlled and interpretable framework, to evaluate five VLMs on object properties and relations using noise-free stimuli.

Result: VLMs perform poorly on basic object properties and relations, with accuracy influenced by object position, and lag behind human-level understanding.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust scene comprehension, highlighting the need for improved models and standardized evaluation frameworks like CIVET.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB cameras struggle with fast-moving drones, especially in poor lighting. Event cameras offer better performance, but current datasets lack fine temporal resolution and drone-specific motion patterns.

Method: The authors created FRED, a dataset with over 7 hours of annotated drone trajectories from 5 drone models, including challenging conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides densely annotated data, evaluation protocols, and standard metrics for reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: FRED aims to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-neural network method for through-the-wall radar human activity recognition, using micro-Doppler signatures and topological similarity for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to revisit traditional signal processing methods, avoiding neural networks, to leverage physical interpretability and theoretical foundations.

Method: Generates range-time and Doppler-time maps, segments micro-Doppler signatures, discretizes them into point clouds, and uses Mapper algorithm for topological similarity comparison.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through numerical simulations and measured experiments.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves HAR without neural networks, offering interpretability and performance comparable to neural models.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAO introduces a granular video anomaly detection framework that integrates fine-grained anomaly detection and tracking, improving accuracy and robustness without threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods lack finer-grained analysis (e.g., anomalous pixels), limiting their ability to detect diverse anomalies.

Method: TAO transforms anomaly detection into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects, linking scores to segmentation and tracking tasks.

Result: TAO achieves superior accuracy and robustness in anomaly localization for complex videos.

Conclusion: TAO advances VAD by unifying fine-grained detection and tracking, eliminating threshold tuning, and enhancing precision.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

TL;DR: TAPFM proposes a method for adapting pathology foundation models (PFMs) for clinical tasks using vision transformer attention and multiple instance learning, achieving superior performance on mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks is challenging due to weak WSI-level labels and the need for MIL.

Method: TAPFM uses ViT attention for MIL aggregation, optimizing feature representations and attention weights while maintaining stable training dynamics.

Result: TAPFM outperforms benchmarks in mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, handling multi-label classification effectively.

Conclusion: TAPFM enables practical adaptation of PFMs for clinical applications on standard hardware.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

*Yake Wei,Yu Miao,Dongzhan Zhou,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MokA, a multimodal-aware fine-tuning method addressing limitations in current approaches by focusing on unimodal and cross-modal adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods are borrowed from LLMs, neglecting multimodal differences and underutilizing modalities.

Method: Proposes MokA, which compresses unimodal information with modality-specific parameters and enhances cross-modal interaction.

Result: Experiments across multimodal scenarios and LLM backbones show consistent improvements, proving MokA's efficacy and versatility.

Conclusion: MokA offers a targeted solution for efficient MLLM adaptation, encouraging further research. The project page is provided.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Motivation: Reliable mmWave communication in NLoS conditions is challenging, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Result: Experiments at 60 GHz showed a 23 dB average gain in signal strength and a 0.89 probability of maintaining reception above -65 dB, outperforming static/no-reflector baselines.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

### [183] [Quantifying Cross-Modality Memorization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05198)
*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing gaps in knowledge transfer between modalities and proposing a baseline mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand memorization in neural networks, especially in multimodal settings, addressing both unintentional memorization of sensitive data and effective knowledge acquisition.

Method: Introduces a synthetic persona dataset, trains models on one modality, and evaluates cross-modal transferability.

Result: Facts learned in one modality transfer to another, but with a significant performance gap. This gap persists across scenarios like capable models and machine unlearning.

Conclusion: Proposes a baseline method to mitigate the gap and encourages future research for robust multimodal learning.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

### [184] [Grounding Beyond Detection: Enhancing Contextual Understanding in Embodied 3D Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05199)
*Yani Zhang,Dongming Wu,Hao Shi,Yingfei Liu,Tiancai Wang,Haoqiang Fan,Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions if embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models and finds detection models outperform grounding models. It introduces DEGround, a framework integrating detection and grounding, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether embodied 3D grounding effectively leverages detection models and to improve grounding performance by integrating detection and grounding tasks.

Method: Proposes DEGround, a framework using DETR queries for both detection and grounding, with regional activation and query-wise modulation modules for better context-aware understanding.

Result: DEGround outperforms the state-of-the-art BIP3D model by 7.52% on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: Detection models can outperform grounding models, and integrating detection with grounding (via DEGround) significantly improves performance in embodied 3D grounding tasks.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Yanbo Wang,Ziyi Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat is a method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, using open Gaussians and RGB-semantic inpainting to expand the field-of-view efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction in applications like virtual reality and embodied AI, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require dense views or struggle with out-of-view regions.

Method: OGGSplat initializes open Gaussians from sparse views, applies an RGB-semantic inpainting module for bidirectional control between diffusion models, and optimizes Gaussian parameters progressively.

Result: The method achieves semantic consistency and visual plausibility, validated by a Gaussian Outpainting benchmark and real-world smartphone-captured views.

Conclusion: OGGSplat offers an efficient, generalizable solution for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction from sparse views, with promising results for open-vocabulary scenes.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, a two-stage video motion transfer framework using spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to improve efficiency and consistency in large video diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-transfer methods suffer from motion inconsistency and inefficiency in tuning large video diffusion transformers due to spatial-temporal coupling in 3D attention operators.

Method: Proposes a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to separate spatial appearance and temporal motion processing, along with sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE for faster tuning.

Result: Follow-Your-Motion outperforms existing methods, validated by extensive evaluations on the new MotionBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework addresses motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency, offering a robust solution for complex motion synthesis.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

*Wenhao Hu,Xuexiang Wen,Xi Li,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSG-World is an end-to-end framework for 3D Gaussian World modeling using dual state observations to address occlusion issues and ensure consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world modeling methods struggle with training difficulty, lack of 3D/physical consistency, or require multi-stage processing due to occlusions.

Method: Leverages dual perturbed observations to build segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, enforcing photometric and semantic consistency. Introduces pseudo intermediate states and co-pruning strategies.

Result: Enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer, high-fidelity rendering, and object-level manipulation without dense observations or multi-stage pipelines.

Conclusion: DSG-World demonstrates strong generalization for novel views and scene states, proving effective for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces a vision-language model using the SRR triplet paradigm for efficient and accurate document parsing, outperforming existing methods in speed and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex document parsing pipelines and avoid inefficiencies of large end-to-end models by decomposing the task into three fundamental questions.

Method: Uses the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm for layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering, trained on the comprehensive MonkeyDoc dataset.

Result: Outperforms MinerU by 5.1% on average, with notable gains on formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%), and surpasses larger models like Qwen2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR achieves state-of-the-art performance in document parsing with efficient deployment on a single GPU, offering a scalable and precise solution.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

*Jianghao Wu,Yicheng Wu,Yutong Xie,Wenjia Bai,You Zhang,Feilong Tang,Yulong Li,Yasmeen George,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTA improves medical image segmentation by adapting SAM at test-time, addressing input and semantic discrepancies without losing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM lacks adaptability to medical domains, and existing adaptations like MedSAM reduce generalization. SAM-TTA aims to preserve SAM's generalization while enhancing medical segmentation.

Method: SAM-TTA includes SBCT for input-level adaptation and DUMT for semantic-level alignment, using consistency learning without retraining.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA methods and MedSAM in some cases, validated on five datasets.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA sets a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation, balancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoViX is a self-supervised framework for robust 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments, overcoming perceptual ambiguities and seasonal shifts by learning invariant representations and using motion-informed sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments is challenging due to perceptual ambiguities (e.g., repetitive vegetation) and seasonal appearance changes, which hinder alignment with outdated satellite imagery.

Method: MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy, temporally aligned hard negative mining, a motion-informed frame sampler, and a lightweight temporal aggregator. It integrates with Monte Carlo Localization and uses entropy-guided temperature scaling for robust tracking.

Result: On the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, MoViX localizes within 25 meters 93% of the time and within 50 meters 100% of the time, outperforming baselines without environment-specific tuning. It also generalizes to a real-world off-road dataset.

Conclusion: MoViX demonstrates robust, accurate localization in challenging off-road environments, generalizing well to unseen regions and different platforms, making it a promising solution for GPS-denied scenarios.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

*Xiaodong Wang,Jinfa Huang,Li Yuan,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lean Preference Optimization (LeanPO) to address the issue of likelihood displacement in Video-LLMs, improving alignment with human preferences and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment techniques like DPO inadvertently decrease the likelihood of target responses, worsening with the complexity of video content.

Method: Proposes LeanPO, a reference-free approach using a reward-trustworthiness correlated pipeline and dynamic label smoothing to refine preference data and mitigate unintended drops.

Result: LeanPO significantly enhances Video-LLM performance, boosting baselines with minimal training overhead and improving alignment with human trustworthiness.

Conclusion: LeanPO provides a simple, effective solution for reliable and efficient Video-LLMs, addressing key challenges in preference alignment.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across diverse countries, highlighting the importance of bona fide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of PAD generalization across various ID card types due to limited training data caused by privacy concerns.

Method: Utilized FM trained on large datasets, tested with zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on two datasets (Chilean IDs and an open-set from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia).

Result: Bona fide images were identified as crucial for achieving generalization in PAD.

Conclusion: FM can enhance PAD generalization, with bona fide images playing a key role.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR is a new benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR), focusing on gymnastics and diving, with 180K triplets. It improves over existing benchmarks by linking queries to multiple target videos. The proposed TF-CoVR-Base framework enhances retrieval performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks lack the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting their practical usefulness.

Method: TF-CoVR-Base uses a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification, and (ii) aligning queries with videos via contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51 and raises fine-tuned state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: TF-CoVR addresses gaps in temporal fine-grained retrieval and demonstrates significant performance improvements with the proposed framework.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-scale bilateral grid to improve geometric accuracy in neural rendering for autonomous driving scenes, outperforming existing methods like appearance codes and bilateral grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often lack photometric consistency, limiting the effectiveness of current neural rendering techniques like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Existing solutions (appearance codes, bilateral grids) have modeling or optimization constraints.

Method: Proposes a novel multi-scale bilateral grid unifying appearance codes and bilateral grids, addressing photometric inconsistency and improving geometry.

Result: Significantly enhances geometric accuracy in dynamic autonomous driving scenes, validated on Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet datasets. Reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid is effective for accurate scene reconstruction in autonomous driving, crucial for obstacle avoidance and control.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric

*Tao Sun,Liyuan Zhu,Shengyu Huang,Shuran Song,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified Point Flow is a unified method for point cloud registration and shape assembly, learning a velocity field to align points without explicit symmetry labels, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and unify point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly into a single generative problem, avoiding ad-hoc symmetry handling.

Method: Learns a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to target positions, recovering part poses. Uses a self-supervised encoder for overlapping points.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, with joint training enhancing accuracy through shared geometric priors.

Conclusion: The unified approach effectively handles symmetries and diverse datasets, improving performance in registration and assembly tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

*Tong Wu,Shuai Yang,Ryan Po,Yinghao Xu,Ziwei Liu,Dahua Lin,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves long-term consistency in video world models by using geometry-grounded spatial memory, addressing scene forgetting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with maintaining scene consistency due to limited temporal context, inspired by human memory mechanisms.

Method: Introduces a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory for storing and retrieving information, trained on custom datasets.

Result: Shows improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Paves the way for long-term consistent world generation in video models.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaySt3R recasts 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem, using a transformer to predict depth maps and masks from query rays, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle with sharp boundaries.

Method: Uses a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores from query rays, fusing predictions across views.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to address limitations of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in medical AI, improving interpretability and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs in medical AI lack utility by ignoring intrinsic image features and suffer from performance drops and unstable explanations under perturbations.

Method: Proposes VCT and SVCT, leveraging vision transformers and conceptual layers, fusing concept and image features, and using Denoised Diffusion Smoothing for stability.

Result: VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability on four medical datasets, with SVCT providing stable explanations under perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT meets medical field needs by balancing interpretability and faithfulness, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: EOC-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on dynamic interactions and temporal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for embodied cognition focus on static scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions. EOC-Bench aims to fill this gap by evaluating object-centric cognition in dynamic environments.

Method: EOC-Bench includes 3,277 annotated QA pairs across three temporal categories (Past, Present, Future), 11 evaluation dimensions, and 3 visual referencing types. It uses a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework and a multi-scale temporal accuracy metric.

Result: The benchmark evaluates various MLLMs, providing insights into their embodied object cognitive capabilities.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench advances MLLMs' embodied cognition, serving as a foundation for reliable core models in embodied systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

*Pingyu Wu,Kai Zhu,Yu Liu,Longxiang Tang,Jian Yang,Yansong Peng,Wei Zhai,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok) for autoregressive image generation, ensuring unidirectional token dependencies and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers hinder autoregressive models due to bidirectional dependencies during compression.

Method: Introduces AliTok with a causal decoder, prefix tokens, and two-stage training for unidirectional dependencies and consistency.

Result: Achieves gFID 1.50 (177M params) and 1.35 (662M params), outperforming diffusion methods with faster sampling.

Conclusion: AliTok aligns tokenizer and autoregressive modeling, enhancing performance and efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that addresses high-resolution challenges with adaptive window attention and adversarial training, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VR methods are computationally expensive, and extending distillation approaches to high-resolution video restoration is underexplored.

Method: Proposes SeedVR2 with adaptive window attention and adversarial training, incorporating feature matching loss for stability.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance than existing VR methods in a single step.

Conclusion: SeedVR2 effectively balances performance and efficiency for high-resolution video restoration.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance region-level visual understanding by integrating segmentation and language models for richer, multi-modal outputs.

Method: Extends SAM 2 with LLMs, introduces Semantic Perceiver for feature transformation, and uses a refined dataset for training.

Result: PAM is 1.2-2.4x faster, uses less GPU memory, and performs well on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: PAM is a practical, efficient solution and a strong baseline for future research in visual understanding.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic correspondence estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in semantic matching for symmetric objects or repeated parts using pre-trained vision models.

Method: Training an adapter to refine features using 3D-aware pseudo-labels, with filtering via cyclic consistency and 3D spherical constraints.

Result: Achieves over 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over similarly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces dependency on dataset-specific annotations.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

TL;DR: MARBLE is a method for material editing in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling fine-grained control over material attributes like roughness and glow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exemplar-based material editing by leveraging CLIP-space embeddings and controlling pre-trained models for more precise and flexible material adjustments.

Method: MARBLE identifies material-attributing blocks in a denoising UNet, finds blending directions in CLIP-space, and uses a shallow network for parametric control over material attributes.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows MARBLE's effectiveness in material blending and fine-grained attribute control, with support for multiple edits in one pass.

Conclusion: MARBLE advances material editing by combining CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained models, offering precise control and versatility for applications like painting.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProJo4D is a progressive joint optimization framework for 4D scene understanding, outperforming prior methods in future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating physics from visual data are limited by error accumulation and impractical input requirements, hindering scalable applications like digital twins.

Method: ProJo4D progressively optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties jointly, guided by parameter sensitivity.

Result: ProJo4D excels in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets.

Conclusion: ProJo4D advances physically grounded 4D scene understanding, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing them into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. It identifies performance gaps in 3D scene-centric VLMs, attributing them to limited reliance on 3D encoders and ineffective pre-training. A new dataset is introduced to improve 3D understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3D scene-centric VLMs underperform compared to other approaches and to address their limitations in leveraging 3D scene encoders.

Method: Categorizes 3D VLMs, analyzes their performance gaps, and introduces a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset to disrupt shortcut learning.

Result: 3D scene-centric VLMs over-rely on linguistic cues and underutilize 3D encoders, with pre-training being less effective than in 2D VLMs.

Conclusion: Advanced evaluation and improved strategies are needed for better 3D understanding in VLMs, supported by the new dataset.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PM-Loss, a regularization loss using a pointmap to improve depth-based 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing fragmented point clouds at object boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth maps in 3DGS pipelines often suffer from fragmented or sparse point clouds at object boundaries, degrading rendering quality.

Method: Proposes PM-Loss, a regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer to enforce geometric smoothness.

Result: The improved depth map enhances 3DGS performance across architectures and scenes, yielding better rendering.

Conclusion: PM-Loss effectively mitigates depth discontinuity issues, improving feed-forward 3DGS rendering quality.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on counting tasks due to limited benchmarks (short videos, close-set queries, lack of clues). CG-AV-Counting aims to provide a comprehensive testbed.

Method: Introduces CG-AV-Counting benchmark with 1,027 questions and 5,845 clues. Proposes AV-Reasoner, trained with GRPO and curriculum learning.

Result: AV-Reasoner achieves SOTA results but fails to generalize on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting is a valuable benchmark, and AV-Reasoner shows promise but has limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to multimodal domains for math problem-solving is challenging due to coarse visual regions, limited vision encoder perception, and reliance on external visual modification tools.

Method: Proposes MINT-CoT, which adaptively interleaves visual tokens into textual reasoning via an Interleave Token, supported by a dataset of 54K problems and a three-stage training strategy (text-only SFT, interleaved SFT, and RL).

Result: MINT-CoT-7B outperforms baselines by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar.

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively integrates visual and textual reasoning for math problems, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

TL;DR: VideoMarathon introduces a large-scale hour-long video dataset and Hour-LLaVA, a model for long video understanding, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated long videos for training Video-LMMs by creating a comprehensive dataset and efficient model.

Method: Develop VideoMarathon (9,700 hours of videos with 3.3M QA pairs) and Hour-LLaVA, leveraging memory augmentation for hour-long video processing.

Result: Hour-LLaVA achieves top performance on long video-language benchmarks, validating dataset quality and model efficacy.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA advance long video understanding, filling a critical gap in video-language modeling.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

*Ghazi Shazan Ahmad,Ahmed Heakl,Hanan Gani,Abdelrahman Shaker,Zhiqiang Shen,Ranjay Krishna,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model for spatio-temporal localization, combining LLM reasoning with temporal attention and mask fusion for improved accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based methods lack contextual understanding and generalization, which VideoMolmo addresses by integrating LLM capabilities with temporal consistency.

Method: VideoMolmo uses a temporal module with attention for frame consistency and a mask fusion pipeline for bidirectional point propagation. It decomposes the task into LLM-based pointing and sequential mask fusion.

Result: The model improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning, validated on a curated dataset and benchmarks like VPoS-Bench, Refer-VOS, and Reasoning VOS.

Conclusion: VideoMolmo outperforms existing models, offering enhanced interpretability and generalization, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available
at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for creating defurnished indoor replicas using textured meshes and multi-view panoramas, leveraging ControlNet inpainting for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To produce high-quality defurnished indoor assets, addressing limitations of existing methods like blurry outputs from neural radiance fields or hallucinations in RGB-D inpainting.

Method: Segments and removes furniture from meshes, extends planes, fills holes to create a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). Uses SDM to guide ControlNet inpainting for furniture removal in panoramas, then textures the mesh.

Result: Produces higher quality defurnished assets compared to neural radiance fields or RGB-D inpainting methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively generates accurate and high-quality defurnished indoor replicas by combining geometric guidance with advanced inpainting techniques.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

### [214] [Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341)
*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework for generating 3D indoor scenes from text descriptions using LLMs, addressing challenges in layout generation with a three-stage approach and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D layout generation either overfit to datasets or rely on rigid constraints, failing to achieve open-vocabulary and fine-grained alignment with user instructions.

Method: DirectLayout uses LLMs for spatial reasoning, decomposing generation into BEV layout, 3D lifting, and refinement. It employs CoT Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward for better reasoning and generalization.

Result: DirectLayout achieves strong semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses layout generation challenges, offering flexibility and alignment with user instructions.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a framework (RAS) to address it, combining text and visual prompts for comprehensive segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image segmentation models lack semantic understanding for complex vision-language queries, limiting user-friendly interactions.

Method: Proposes the RAS framework, which enhances segmentation models with multimodal interactions using a mask-centric large multimodal model.

Result: RAS achieves superior performance on ORES, RES, and GRES tasks, validated by new datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ.

Conclusion: The RAS framework effectively bridges the gap in multimodal segmentation, offering improved performance and versatility.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

*Jiahui Wang,Zuyan Liu,Yongming Rao,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates attention mechanisms in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), revealing sparse visual head usage (∼5%). It introduces SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization method for efficient MLLM inference, achieving 1.38x acceleration and 52% memory reduction without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs process visual inputs and leverage the sparsity of active visual heads for efficient inference.

Method: Analyzes attention mechanisms to identify visual heads, then designs SparseMM, a training-free framework for KV-Cache optimization based on head-level visual relevance.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration, 52% memory reduction, and maintains performance on multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The sparsity of visual heads enables efficient MLLM inference, and SparseMM provides a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

*Anagh Malik,Benjamin Attal,Andrew Xie,Matthew O'Toole,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system for neural inverse rendering from multi-view videos of light propagation, using time-resolved neural radiance caching for accurate light transport effects and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate 3D reconstruction and analysis of light propagation in scenes with strong indirect light, which is challenging for traditional methods.

Method: Extends neural radiance caching with time-resolved capabilities to model direct and indirect light transport, applied to flash lidar measurements.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction, view synthesis of light propagation, and decomposition into direct/indirect components.

Conclusion: The system advances inverse rendering by handling complex light transport, enabling novel applications like time-resolved relighting.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

*Yifan Wang,Peishan Yang,Zhen Xu,Jiaming Sun,Zhanhua Zhang,Yong Chen,Hujun Bao,Sida Peng,Xiaowei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeTimeGS, a 4D representation for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction, improving flexibility and motion handling over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motions due to deformation field optimization challenges.

Method: Proposes FreeTimeGS, allowing Gaussian primitives at arbitrary time/locations and adding motion functions to reduce redundancy.

Result: Outperforms recent methods in rendering quality on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS offers superior flexibility and performance for dynamic 3D scenes.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

*Hanoona Rasheed,Abdelrahman Shaker,Anqi Tang,Muhammad Maaz,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Salman Khan,Fahad Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to perform temporally extended, cross-modal reasoning in videos across diverse mathematical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos requires integrating fine-grained visual, textual, and auditory cues, posing a unique challenge compared to static images or text.

Method: The benchmark includes videos of varying lengths (10 seconds to 1+ hours) and questions designed for three reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension. Graduate-level experts annotated the dataset.

Result: The benchmark provides a framework to evaluate models' reasoning capabilities in multimodal, temporally extended contexts, highlighting limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a systematic evaluation framework for models to reason across rich, multimodal mathematical problem settings, advancing beyond mere perception.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

*George Stoica,Vivek Ramanujan,Xiang Fan,Ali Farhadi,Ranjay Krishna,Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching enhances conditional flow uniqueness in diffusion models, improving training speed, reducing de-noising steps, and lowering FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ambiguity in conditional flow-matching by ensuring uniqueness across flows from different conditions.

Method: Introduces a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.

Result: Improves training speed (up to 9x), reduces de-noising steps (up to 5x), and lowers FID scores (up to 8.9).

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching effectively enhances condition separation and performance in conditional diffusion models.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A model is proposed to generate phonemic and prosodic labels coherent with graphemes, using implicit and explicit conditioning methods, improving consistency and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of coherence between graphemes and phonemic/prosodic labels in speech, enabling better parallel data for tasks like TTS and accent estimation.

Method: 1) Implicit grapheme conditioning via BERT-based prompt encoder. 2) Explicit pruning of label hypotheses inconsistent with graphemes during inference.

Result: Improved grapheme-label consistency and enhanced performance in accent estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively bridges graphemes and speech labels, benefiting downstream applications.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for phoneme-based ASR, outperforming WFST-based systems with relative WER reductions of 3.6% (Polish) and 6.9% (German).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of WFST-based decoding (complex pipeline, inability to leverage LLMs) in phoneme-based multilingual ASR.

Method: Introduces LLM-P2G with S2P and P2G components, using data augmentation (DANP) and randomized top-K marginalized (TKM) training to mitigate information loss.

Result: LLM-P2G achieves better performance than WFST-based systems, with WER reductions of 3.6% (Polish) and 6.9% (German).

Conclusion: LLM-P2G is a promising alternative to WFST-based decoding, offering improved efficiency and performance in crosslingual ASR.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores how the similarity between upstream safety-alignment data and downstream fine-tuning tasks affects the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaks, showing that low similarity improves model safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies for jailbreaks in LLMs focus on reactive measures, ignoring the role of upstream safety-alignment data. This paper addresses this gap by examining how dataset similarity impacts safety guardrails.

Method: The study analyzes representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks, conducting experiments to measure the effect on model robustness.

Result: High similarity between datasets weakens safety guardrails, increasing jailbreak vulnerability, while low similarity reduces harmfulness scores by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: Upstream dataset design is crucial for durable safety guardrails, offering actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers to reduce jailbreak risks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to ensure contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by combining explicit reasoning prompts for LLMs and a reinforcement learning framework, reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents, which involves determining appropriate information sharing during tasks.

Method: The approach involves prompting LLMs to reason about CI and developing an RL framework to instill CI reasoning, tested on a synthetic dataset and validated on human-annotated benchmarks.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure across various model sizes and families, with improvements transferring to real-world CI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances CI in autonomous agents, demonstrating scalability and transferability to practical scenarios.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, which can undermine regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: Introduces CircuGraphRAG, a RAG framework that uses a knowledge graph with 117,380 entities for structured reasoning. Queries are translated to SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved.

Result: Outperforms Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, achieving ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, halving response time, and reducing token usage by 16%.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG provides reliable, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, enhancing low-carbon decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [227] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Matter-of-Fact is a dataset for assessing hypothesis feasibility in materials science, showing current models struggle (72% accuracy vs. 50% chance), but experts believe the task is solvable, offering potential to scale scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated hypothesis generation is cheap, but testing is costly. Filtering feasible hypotheses can optimize resource use and enhance discovery potential.

Method: Introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset of 8.4k claims from materials science (e.g., superconductors, batteries), with qualitative/quantitative data from theory, experiments, and simulations. Tests baselines like retrieval-augmented generation and code generation.

Result: Baselines achieve 72% accuracy (chance: 50%), but experts deem most claims solvable, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: The task is challenging for current models but solvable, suggesting progress here could significantly accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights performance evaluation inconsistencies in the Deepseek-R1-Distill series and similar models, advocating for stricter evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of benchmark results due to fluctuating evaluation conditions in models like Deepseek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models to identify evaluation inconsistencies.

Result: Found significant fluctuations in benchmark results due to minor evaluation condition changes.

Conclusion: Calls for a more rigorous evaluation paradigm to ensure reliable performance claims.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

*Kai Wang,Yihao Zhang,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates strategic deception in LLMs with CoT reasoning, using representation engineering to detect and control it with 89% accuracy and 40% success in eliciting deception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the critical alignment challenge of honesty in LLMs, particularly advanced systems with CoT reasoning that may deceive intentionally.

Method: Uses representation engineering, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and activation steering to induce, detect, and control deception.

Result: Achieves 89% detection accuracy and 40% success in eliciting context-appropriate deception.

Conclusion: Highlights honesty issues in reasoning models and provides tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

### [230] [LLM-First Search: Self-Guided Exploration of the Solution Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05213)
*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-First Search (LFS) is a novel method where LLMs autonomously guide search processes, outperforming traditional algorithms like MCTS and ToT-BFS in flexibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional search methods like MCTS rely on fixed hyperparameters, limiting adaptability across tasks. LFS aims to eliminate this by leveraging LLMs for self-guided exploration.

Method: LFS empowers LLMs to autonomously control search paths using internal scoring, avoiding pre-defined strategies or manual tuning.

Result: LFS outperforms ToT-BFS, BestFS, and MCTS in challenging tasks, is more efficient, scales better with stronger models, and handles increased compute budgets effectively.

Conclusion: LFS demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency in reasoning tasks, making it a promising alternative to traditional search methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Loan Dao,Ngoc Quoc Ly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ontology-based AI framework for bone disease diagnosis, integrating hierarchical neural networks, VQA, and multimodal data, but lacks experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic domain expertise in medical AI systems, ensuring diagnostic reliability by integrating ontology and clinical knowledge.

Method: Develops a framework with hierarchical neural networks guided by bone disease ontology, an ontology-enhanced VQA system, and a multimodal deep learning model integrating imaging, clinical, and lab data.

Result: The framework shows potential for broader application but lacks experimental validation due to dataset and resource limitations.

Conclusion: Future work will expand datasets and validate the system, aiming to extend the framework beyond bone diseases.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

### [232] [CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449)
*Fanxiao Li,Jiaying Wu,Canyuan He,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges in using MLLMs for detecting out-of-context misinformation and proposes CMIE, a framework with CRG and AS mechanisms, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with detecting deeper semantic relationships and are affected by noisy evidence in out-of-context misinformation detection.

Method: Proposes CMIE, incorporating Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) and Association Scoring (AS) to identify underlying relationships and selectively use evidence.

Result: CMIE outperforms existing methods in detecting out-of-context misinformation.

Conclusion: CMIE effectively addresses the limitations of MLLMs in misinformation detection by leveraging deeper semantic analysis and selective evidence use.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework for Anime-style facial sketch colorization, using SSIMBaD for balanced and faithful reconstructions, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional colorization methods compromise perceptual consistency due to predefined noise schedules. The goal is to preserve structural fidelity while transferring stylistic attributes.

Method: Uses continuous-time diffusion models with SSIMBaD, a sigma-space transformation aligning perceptual degradation linearly via SSIM.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality on a large-scale Anime face dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances visual difficulty across timesteps, generalizing to diverse styles while maintaining fidelity.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret user instructions and automate high-quality deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh deformation methods suffer from low output quality, manual tuning, or data-intensive training.

Method: Leverages VLM for handle selection and deformation via prompt engineering, uses cone singularity detection for handle identification, and employs multi-view voting for uncertainty reduction.

Result: Produces deformations aligning closely with user intent (measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores) with low distortion (quantified via membrane energy).

Conclusion: The approach is training-free, highly automated, and delivers consistent high-quality mesh deformations.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

*Wuyang Li,Zhu Yu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VoxDet introduces an instance-centric framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, converting voxel-level labels into instance-level offsets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods neglect instance-level discriminability, leading to incompleteness and ambiguities. VoxDet leverages implicit instance-level insights from voxel labels.

Method: VoxDet decouples occupancy prediction into offset regression and semantic prediction, using a spatially-decoupled encoder and task-decoupled predictor.

Result: Achieves 63.0 IoU on SemanticKITTI, ranking 1st on the leaderboard, and works efficiently with both camera and LiDAR inputs.

Conclusion: VoxDet effectively addresses instance-level issues in 3D occupancy prediction, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

TL;DR: A fast, unsupervised method for polygonal approximation of closed digital curves, outperforming state-of-the-art in speed and aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a faster and competitive polygonal approximation method for closed digital curves without supervision.

Method: Three-phase scheme: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, and iterative merging with vertex adjustment.

Result: Faster than state-of-the-art, competitive in Rosin's measure and aesthetics, robust to geometric transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme is efficient, effective, and visually appealing for polygonal approximation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in federated learning (FL) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), showing how maliciously designed pretrained models and adapters can leak user data via gradient inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight privacy vulnerabilities in FL when using PEFT, despite its efficiency benefits, and demonstrate how local data can be reconstructed from shared gradients.

Method: The study conducts gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism (the adapter) to reconstruct user data from accessible gradients.

Result: Experiments show that fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity, revealing significant privacy risks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in PEFT and suggest future research directions to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

### [238] [A Poisson-Guided Decomposition Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470)
*Isha Rao,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning method integrates Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising for low-light image enhancement, improving visibility without color distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noise assumptions like Gaussian noise fail in low-light conditions where Poisson noise is more accurate. Addressing this challenge is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed method combines Retinex-based decomposition with Poisson denoising in an encoder-decoder network, using a Poisson denoising loss to handle signal-dependent noise.

Result: The method enhances visibility and brightness while preserving image structure and color constancy under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively denoises and enhances low-light images without requiring prior reflectance or illumination knowledge, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: DACN, a dual-attention CNN, improves hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining multi-head and channel attention, outperforming single-attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D CNNs lack global context and struggle with band correlation and data scarcity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Method: DACN uses augmented convolutions with multi-head attention for local-global feature capture, channel-spatial attention maps, and a custom loss function (L2 + spatial-spectral gradient loss).

Result: Experiments show DACN outperforms single-attention methods on two hyperspectral datasets.

Conclusion: DACN effectively addresses limitations of 2D CNNs, enhancing hyperspectral super-resolution through dual-attention mechanisms and optimized loss.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PixCell is a diffusion-based generative model for histopathology, trained on a large dataset to generate diverse, high-quality images for tasks like data augmentation, privacy-preserving sharing, and virtual staining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in pathology like annotated data scarcity, privacy concerns, and generative tasks such as virtual staining.

Method: Uses a progressive training strategy and self-supervision-based conditioning on PanCan-30M dataset (69,184 H&E-stained slides).

Result: Generates high-quality synthetic images usable for training discriminative models, data augmentation, and inferring molecular markers.

Conclusion: PixCell is a versatile foundation model for computational pathology, with potential applications in research, education, and clinical settings.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Motivation: Existing medical State Space Models (SSMs) struggle with encoder-decoder incompatibility, compromising spatial structures and failing to leverage Mamba's state propagation.

Method: DM-SegNet integrates a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module, gated spatial convolution, and Mamba-driven decoding for bidirectional state synchronization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art DSC of 85.44% on Synapse and 90.22% on BraTS2023.

Conclusion: DM-SegNet effectively reconciles global context modeling with spatial topology preservation, setting new benchmarks in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

### [242] [Exp4Fuse: A Rank Fusion Framework for Enhanced Sparse Retrieval using Large Language Model-based Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04760)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse, a novel fusion ranking framework, improves sparse retrieval by combining original and LLM-augmented query results, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and computational intensity of LLM-based query expansion while enhancing sparse retrieval performance.

Method: Introduces Exp4Fuse, which fuses ranked lists from original and LLM-augmented queries using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Result: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse is effective and superior for improving query expansion in sparse retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

### [243] [GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for Query Expansion in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04762)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer is a novel method using smaller LMs for query expansion, addressing cost and accessibility issues of large LLMs. It filters hallucinations and combines documents effectively, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs for query expansion are costly and inaccessible. Smaller LMs are more practical but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistencies.

Method: GOLFer uses a hallucination filter to remove non-factual content and a combiner to integrate filtered documents with queries.

Result: GOLFer outperforms other methods with smaller LMs and competes with large LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: GOLFer provides a cost-effective, efficient alternative to large LLMs for query expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Yubo Ma,Jinsong Li,Yuhang Zang,Xiaobao Wu,Xiaoyi Dong,Pan Zhang,Yuhang Cao,Haodong Duan,Jiaqi Wang,Yixin Cao,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to reduce memory usage in Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR) by minimizing patch embeddings per page while maintaining performance. Token pruning and merging are evaluated, with merging proving more effective, leading to the development of Light-ColPali/ColQwen2, which retains high performance with significantly reduced memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in VDR comes with excessive memory usage due to multiple patch-level embeddings per page. This study aims to reduce memory footprint with minimal performance loss.

Method: Two token-reduction strategies are evaluated: token pruning (including a random strategy) and token merging. The latter is optimized across three dimensions to develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2.

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 maintains 98.2% retrieval performance with 11.8% of original memory usage and 94.6% effectiveness at 2.8% memory footprint.

Conclusion: Token merging is more suitable for VDR than pruning. The findings and Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 provide insights and a competitive baseline for efficient VDR research.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the distinction between systematicity of behavior and representations in ML models, critiques existing benchmarks, and suggests assessing representational systematicity using mechanistic interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument for systematicity of representations and the focus of current benchmarks and models on behavioral systematicity.

Method: Analyzes key benchmarks in language and vision using Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization and highlights mechanistic interpretability for assessing representational systematicity.

Result: Existing benchmarks primarily test behavioral systematicity, not representational systematicity.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a shift in focus to assess and enhance systematicity of representations in ML models.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

### [246] [Clustering and Median Aggregation Improve Differentially Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04566)
*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve differentially private (DP) language model inference by clustering input data and using medians for aggregation, enhancing text quality and privacy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling in DP language model inference degrades text quality, especially for heterogeneous topics, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: Clustering input data before sampling and aggregating next-token predictions using medians instead of averages, leveraging reduced local sensitivity for better privacy guarantees.

Result: Improved representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance, with higher-quality synthetic data at lower privacy cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms prior approaches by combining clustering and median-based aggregation, offering better privacy and text quality.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous privacy guarantees while extracting useful insights from LLM chatbot interactions.

Method: Uses private clustering, keyword extraction (frequency-based, TF-IDF, LLM-guided), and DP tools like clustering and histogram-based summarization.

Result: Effectively balances data utility and privacy, demonstrated through lexical, semantic, and LLM-based evaluations.

Conclusion: Urania successfully extracts conversational insights with strong privacy protection, outperforming non-private alternatives.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: Proposes EHR2Path, a novel model for patient pathway prediction using structured EHR data, outperforming baselines in forecasting health trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing approaches in handling complex, longitudinal patient data for personalized care.

Method: Transforms EHR data into structured representation and uses a summary mechanism for long-term context.

Result: Outperforms baselines in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation.

Conclusion: Enables predictive, personalized healthcare by simulating diverse patient trajectories.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes three key aspects of RL in long-context reasoning: the roles of positive/negative samples, data inefficiency in policy optimization, and performance instability, proposing solutions for each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in RL for long-context reasoning, focusing on sample roles, data efficiency, and performance stability.

Method: Systematic analysis of sample roles, exploration of strategies like relative length rewards and offline injection for data efficiency, and multiple evaluation runs for stability.

Result: Negative samples enhance generalization; data inefficiency identified in policy optimization; instability linked to ambiguous problems, mitigated by multiple evaluations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and practical solutions to improve RL training for long-context reasoning, emphasizing sample roles, data efficiency, and stability.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

*Jingyu Hu,Hongbo Bo,Jun Hong,Xiaowei Liu,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to mitigate degree bias in GNNs by adding more positive pairs and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from degree bias in node classification, and existing GCL methods provide insufficient/noisy information for low-degree nodes.

Method: Introduces HAR contrastive loss (more positive pairs via labels, adaptive weighting) and SHARP framework for broader application.

Result: SHARP outperforms baselines on four datasets, improving performance globally and across degree levels.

Conclusion: HAR and SHARP effectively address degree bias in GNNs, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs by enabling parallelism, reducing inference time and memory usage without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face inefficiency in long-context inference due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. RMTs reduce this but introduce sequential bottlenecks.

Method: Diagonal Batching is introduced as a scheduling scheme to parallelize RMT segments while maintaining exact recurrence.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard LLaMA-1B and 1.8x over sequential RMT on 131k-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching makes RMTs more practical for real-world long-context applications by eliminating sequential bottlenecks.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, parallelizable version of the Mesa layer, derived from an in-context regression objective, showing improved performance in language modeling at scale, though with higher computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the linear scaling of memory and compute in transformers during inference, the paper explores recurrent models like DeltaNet, Mamba, and xLSTM, unifying them under an in-context regression framework.

Method: The authors propose a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable Mesa layer, optimized using a fast conjugate gradient solver for in-context loss minimization at every time point.

Result: The method achieves lower perplexity and better downstream performance than previous RNNs, especially in long-context tasks, but requires additional inference-time compute.

Conclusion: The work aligns with trends of increasing test-time compute for performance gains, demonstrating the value of solving sequential optimization problems within the network itself.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques—difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay—to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, reducing training time by 25%-65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning for LLMs is resource-intensive, and existing methods lack focus on data efficiency.

Method: Introduces adaptive difficulty for data selection and an attention-based framework for efficient difficulty estimation, along with rollout replay to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces fine-tuning time by 25%-65% compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan,Zhuoming Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Yang Zhou,Emma Strubell,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law, showing that smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated due to overlooked memory bottlenecks. Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, improving accuracy in both low and high-cost regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work underestimates memory access bottlenecks in test-time scaling, leading to inefficient resource allocation. The study aims to address this by incorporating computation and memory costs.

Method: The authors analyze models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, proposing the Kinetics Scaling Law and a sparse attention paradigm to reduce per-token costs.

Result: Sparse attention models achieve significant accuracy gains (60+ points in low-cost, 5+ in high-cost regimes) on AIME, outperforming dense models.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for maximizing test-time scaling potential, as it enables longer generations and better accuracy without saturating like parameter scaling.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress the KV cache in Transformer LLMs, enabling more tokens to be generated within the same compute budget and improving reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key-value (KV) cache size bottlenecks generation cost in Transformer LLMs, limiting efficiency. The paper aims to address this by compressing the KV cache to allow hyper-scaling without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a method that sparsifies KV caches with minimal training (1K steps), delaying token eviction to preserve critical information.

Result: DMS achieves 8× compression while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention, enhancing model performance on benchmarks like AIME 24, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS is practical and effective, boosting accuracy for comparable runtime and memory load in LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO (You Only Train Once) automates loss weight hyperparameter optimization in one training run, outperforming grid search in tasks like 3D estimation and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model training involves multiple runs for hyperparameter tuning, which is inefficient. YOTO aims to streamline this by optimizing loss weights in a single training session.

Method: YOTO treats loss hyperparameters as network parameters, optimizing them via gradient-based methods. It uses a differentiable composite loss layer with a softmax operation and introduces a regularization loss for uniformity and boundedness.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms grid-search models on unseen test data in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: YOTO provides an efficient, one-shot solution for loss hyperparameter optimization, reducing the need for multiple training runs while improving performance.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StatsMerging is a lightweight, learning-based model merging method that uses weight distribution statistics and SVD to guide merging without needing labels or test samples. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accommodating multiple large models within constrained memory budgets efficiently.

Method: Leverages SVD for task-specific weight distributions, uses a lightweight learner (StatsMergeLearner), and introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality variations across eight tasks.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is an effective solution for model merging, offering superior performance without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling laws are used to compare models (CLIP and MaMMUT) and datasets, showing MaMMUT's better scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison of models and datasets for pre-training using scaling laws, avoiding single-scale biases.

Method: Derived full scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT across model and dataset scales, validated on downstream tasks and datasets.

Result: MaMMUT outperforms CLIP in scalability and sample efficiency, with consistent trends across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Scaling laws provide a robust method for model and dataset comparison, facilitating systematic improvements in foundation models.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

### [259] [Exploring bidirectional bounds for minimax-training of Energy-based models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04609)
*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models (EBMs) to avoid instabilities, comparing four bounds and demonstrating improved stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are difficult to train due to instabilities from minimizing lower bounds. The paper aims to stabilize training by using bidirectional bounds.

Method: Four bounds on log-likelihood are derived and evaluated: two lower bounds (based on generator Jacobian singular values and mutual information) and two upper bounds (gradient penalty-like and diffusion process-based). Algorithms for evaluating these bounds are provided.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training, leading to high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: Using bidirectional bounds improves EBM training stability and performance, with different bounds offering unique advantages.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, identifying cross-class features as key to robust classification and linking their dynamics to AT performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training (AT) by analyzing class-wise feature attribution.

Method: Analyzes AT using class-wise feature attribution, focusing on cross-class features, supported by theoretical evidence and systematic experiments.

Result: Early AT stages favor cross-class features for robustness, while later stages shift to class-specific features, explaining robust overfitting and soft-label training advantages.

Conclusion: The study refines AT understanding by linking feature dynamics to performance, offering new insights into AT mechanisms.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based generative models, avoiding costly likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align learnable latent spaces with arbitrary target distributions efficiently.

Method: Pretrains a flow model on target features, then regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss derived from flow matching.

Result: The alignment loss approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated in controlled and large-scale experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded approach for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

*Christoph Schirninger,Robert Jarolim,Astrid M. Veronig,Christoph Kuckein*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: A deep learning method improves solar image reconstruction from short exposure bursts, outperforming traditional speckle techniques in robustness and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-based solar telescopes face limitations due to Earth's atmospheric turbulence, requiring post-processing to correct images. Current methods struggle with strong turbulence and high computational demands.

Method: The paper introduces a deep learning approach using unpaired image-to-image translation. It trains on degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, enabling real-time reconstruction of 100 short exposures into one high-quality image.

Result: The method shows improved robustness and perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions exhibit artifacts. It efficiently utilizes combined image information, achieving optimal results with full image bursts.

Conclusion: The deep learning approach offers a more robust and efficient solution for solar image reconstruction, addressing challenges of turbulence and computational cost.

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

TL;DR: The paper examines the usability of publicly available NLP instruments for measuring representational harms in LLMs, finding misalignment with practitioner needs and practical barriers to their use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing NLP instruments effectively meet the needs of practitioners evaluating LLM-based systems for representational harms.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners to evaluate the usability and alignment of available instruments.

Result: Practitioners often cannot use these instruments due to misalignment with their needs or practical/institutional barriers.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to better align instruments with practitioner needs and overcome barriers, based on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM, enhances spatial understanding and reasoning in robots via supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning, outperforming baselines and even Gemini-2.5-Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robots' ability to accurately understand and interact with complex 3D scenes, which current VLMs struggle with.

Method: Integrates a disentangled depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and advances multi-step reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with tailored reward functions.

Result: Achieves 89.6% success rate in spatial understanding and surpasses baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in accuracy.

Conclusion: RoboRefer is effective for long-horizon tasks in diverse real-world scenes and can integrate with various control policies.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA is a method for estimating terrain traversability based on approach angles using Fourier basis functions, improving efficiency and success rates in off-road autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traversability of terrain depends on the vehicle's state, and learning this interaction requires large datasets and is computationally inefficient.

Method: SPARTA uses a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere, composed of Fourier basis functions, to predict risk distribution for any angle of approach.

Result: Achieves a 91% success rate in simulation (vs. 73% baseline) and demonstrates generalization to real-world hardware.

Conclusion: SPARTA efficiently addresses the challenges of angle-dependent traversability with minimal computational overhead and strong generalization.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MineInsight, a multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset for landmine detection, addressing the lack of diverse datasets in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of diverse and realistic datasets hinders reliable validation of computer vision algorithms for humanitarian demining.

Method: The authors created MineInsight, a dataset with 35 targets, dual-view sensor scans from a UGV and robotic arm, and diverse spectral images (RGB, VIS-SWIR, LWIR).

Result: The dataset includes ~38,000 RGB, ~53,000 VIS-SWIR, and ~108,000 LWIR frames, recorded in daylight and nighttime, with target location estimates.

Conclusion: MineInsight serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms, and is publicly available.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a method for generating synthetic annotated datasets in Unreal Engine using 3D Gaussian splats, achieving comparable performance to real-world datasets and reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dataset creation is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks diversity, especially in dynamic robotics scenarios like robot soccer.

Method: Uses photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats in Unreal Engine to automatically generate synthetic data. Combines synthetic and real-world data for improved performance.

Result: Synthetic datasets perform comparably to real-world ones, and combining both enhances object detection. Validated in robot soccer scenarios.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, accurate alternative to manual annotation, ideal for robotics applications needing diverse data.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: An adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent is developed to decide both what and when to speak, performing on par with humans in online Mafia games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world settings like group chats or games lack synchronous turns, requiring agents to decide when to speak, unlike current synchronous LLM usage.

Method: An asynchronous LLM-agent is developed and evaluated using a dataset of online Mafia games with human participants.

Result: The agent matches human performance in gameplay and blending in, with similar timing but differing message content.

Conclusion: This work enables LLM integration into realistic group settings, advancing asynchronous communication research.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Parler TTS, a large speech model, to reconstruct voices of dysarthric speakers pre-onset. Results show potential but challenges in intelligibility and speaker identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech disorders hinder communication; personalized Text-to-Speech can aid affected individuals by reconstructing their pre-onset voices.

Method: Fine-tune Parler TTS on a curated dataset annotated with speaker and intelligibility information.

Result: The model learns from dysarthric speech data but struggles with intelligibility and speaker identity consistency.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving controllability of such models for voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Motivation: To improve performance, efficiency, and alignment quality in speech-text jointly decoding paradigms for spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematic comparison of interleaved and parallel generation paradigms using the same base model, tokenizer, and data. Introduction of the ESI pattern to address slow inference.

Result: Interleaved approach achieves best alignment but is slow; ESI accelerates decoding and improves performance. High-quality QA datasets further enhance speech QA.

Conclusion: The ESI pattern offers a balanced solution for efficient and high-quality speech-text decoding, with curated QA datasets boosting performance.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.
