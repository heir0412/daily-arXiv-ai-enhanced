TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种大型语言模型适应策略在痴呆症检测中的应用，发现适当的模型适应方法（包括演示选择、推理设计和调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测至关重要，且开源模型经过适当调整后可以匹配或超越商业系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国超过一半的阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症患者未被诊断，基于语音的筛查提供了一种可扩展的检测方法。需要探索有效的语言模型适应策略来提高痴呆症检测的准确性。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。适应策略包括：上下文学习（不同演示选择策略）、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态集成。

Result: 类中心演示获得最佳上下文学习性能，推理改善了较小模型，令牌级微调通常产生最佳分数。添加分类头显著改善了表现不佳的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超越顶级纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适应策略（包括演示选择、推理设计和调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测具有关键影响，适当调整的开源模型可以匹配或超越商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA)框架，通过自合成数据和强化学习来提升语音大语言模型在指令跟随任务中的性能，超越了传统蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本LLMs存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态变化的用户语音时表现不佳。

Method: 采用自合成方法通过强大的教师LLM生成高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，无需人工标注的监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务中达到了最先进的性能，仅使用自生成数据。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著缩小语音LLMs与文本LLMs之间的性能差距，为多模态语言模型的发展提供了有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调Mistral 7B大语言模型结合RAG技术进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析，生成图表和文本摘要，并通过层次堆叠生成综合报告


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供互补的图表和文本视角，实现信息丰富的定性和定量分析

Method: 采用4位量化的PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过知识图谱表示加密货币新闻，进行多层次分析：第一层生成图表和文本摘要及情感分数，高层进行层次堆叠整合

Result: 微调后的Mistral 7B模型能够有效进行加密货币新闻的多层次分析，生成信息丰富的定性和定量分析结果，提供重要见解

Conclusion: 该方法能够基本消除大语言模型的幻觉问题，为加密货币新闻分析提供互补的图表和文本视角，实现有效的多层次分析

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个从1987年到2022年意大利立法过程的综合事件日志，使用LLM从非结构化数据创建，旨在促进法律流程挖掘的发展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域受限于数据集的可访问性和质量，需要高质量的法律流程数据集来推动该领域发展

Method: 从Normattiva门户获取非结构化数据，使用大语言模型(LLMs)进行结构化处理，创建ProLiFIC事件日志

Result: 成功构建了涵盖35年意大利立法过程的综合事件日志，为法律流程挖掘提供了基准数据集

Conclusion: ProLiFIC可作为法律流程挖掘的基准数据集，促进该领域与LLM技术的整合，推动新的研究发展

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过层次话语树编码营收会议调用，结合文本、音频、视频情感信号和话语元数据，生成语义丰富的嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法抓取营收会议调用这种半结构化财务沟通的层次话语结构。

Method: 使用两阶段Transformer架构：第一阶段通过对比学习在节点级利用多模态内容和话语元数据进行编码，第二阶段综合生成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义意义丰富的表示，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该系统不仅在财务报告领域有应用价值，还能扩展到医疗电话、教育和政治话语等高风险非脚本化沟通领域，提供了稳健可解释的多模态话语表示方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 早期自杀意念预测模型Early-SIB，通过分析青少年在论坛上的帖子和互动，在本人明确表达自杀意念前预测自杀风险，准确率达73%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会。

Method: 提出Early-SIB模型，使用transformer结构顺序处理用户发布和互动的论坛帖子，预测是否会写出自杀意念相关内容。特点是在用户明确自我曝露自杀意念前进行预测。

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛数据上，模型完成平衡准确率0.73，成功预测未来的自杀意念和行为。

Conclusion: 这种基于社交媒体的预测工具可以作为传统方法的有力补充，为早期干预青少年自杀风险提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种基于实体级判别的假写检测方法，通过线性探针在长文本生成中实时识别假写标记，在70B模型上实现了高效检测（AUC 0.90）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗、法律等高风险场景中的假写问题可能造成严重害备，而现有检测方法或限于短词条查询或需要昂贵外部验证，无法满足实际应用需求

Method: 通过网络搜索标注模型响应中的假造实体，构建标签数据集，使用简单高效的线性探针方法训练假写分类器

Result: 在四个模型家族上均表现优异，在长文本响应中AUC达到0.90（Llama-3.3-70B），超过语义熵动等更昂贵方法，同时在短形式问答中也有改善，还能泛化到数学推理任务

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的实际假写检测提供了有前景的新途径，虽然标注过程较昂贵，但一个模型的标注数据可重用于其他模型，研究团队公开了数据集以便重用

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于几何聚类优化空间邻近性，而非下游信息理论分析，存在理论与实践的脱节

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发原则性主题识别方法，用计算高效上界替代难处理的KL散度项，实现熵正则化和鲁棒化的K-means聚类

Result: UDIB方法在LLM提示和响应嵌入的联合聚类中生成共享主题表示，不仅空间连贯，而且从根本上构建为对提示-响应关系最具信息性

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供更优越的基础，并为检测幻觉提供了新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR²框架通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，使用教师模型将核心问题转化为复杂叙述，学生模型学习提取底层计算模式，显著提升未见编程任务的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象能力是计算机科学中的核心技能

Method: 提出AR²对抗性强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的复杂描述但不改变底层逻辑，学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理和问题解决能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来提升LLM的事实性准确性，结合内部知识提取和外部知识检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在产生事实一致答案方面遇到困难，现有RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理，限制了组合推理能力

Method: 动态构建和扩展知识图：从问题中提取种子KG，通过LLM潜在知识迭代扩展，然后通过外部检索精经选择性精炼

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上表现一致提升，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的有前景方向，具有结构化、可解释性和可扩展性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse框架有效解决了多文档科学推理任务的关键挑战，包括时间对齐松散结构方法和标准化异构实验表格，并提供了相应的基准数据集。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: 传统OCR系统Sprinklr-Edge-OCR在边缘部署场景中优于大型视觉语言模型，具有更高的效率和更低的成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声、多样化真实场景图像中的OCR挑战，比较传统OCR系统与大型视觉语言模型在边缘部署环境中的性能

Method: 构建Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，并在54种语言的数据集上对5种LVLM和2种传统OCR系统进行大规模比较评估，涵盖准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等指标

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均0.17秒/图像)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图像0.006美元)

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是比大型语言模型更优的选择

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: 本文研究通过轻量级引导向量缓解LLM作为评估器时的自我偏好偏见，无需重新训练即可在推理时减少97%的不合理自我偏好偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动化评估器时存在自我偏好偏见，倾向于偏爱自己的输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建引导向量，并在精心策划的数据集上测试这些方法，该数据集区分了合理和不合理的自我偏好示例。

Result: 引导向量能将不合理自我偏好偏见减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法。但在合理自我偏好和无偏见一致性方面表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 引导向量作为LLM作为评判者的保障措施具有前景但也存在局限，表明自我偏好涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更稳健的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义向量相似性，研究发现这两种方法在提高临床文档完整性、揭示潜在临床关联和支持决策应用方面具有互补价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记含有丰富的临床叙述，但非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战。SNOMED CT等标准化术语提高了互操性，但概念间的共现关系和语义相似性研究仍然不足。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)，分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式与语义相似性的关系，并考察这些关系在时间和专业领域上的演化。

Result: 共现和语义相似性呈弱相关关系，但向量嵌入能抓取临床意义上的关联关系；向量建议的概念经常与后期文档记录相符；概念聚类形成了一致的临床主题；共现模式与死亡率、再入院等结果相关联。

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义向量嵌入在改善文档完整性、发现潜在临床关联和支持决策应用方面具有互补价值，为临床决策支持和表型分析提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

TL;DR: 提出基于度量学习的少样本学习方法MLSD，用于跨目标和跨领域的立场检测，通过三元组损失构建判别性嵌入空间，在多个跨域场景中显著提升立场检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域立场检测中的领域适应问题，传统方法在新目标领域表现不佳，需要能够有效利用有限样本进行领域适应的新方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间，使模型能够从新目标领域获取有用的示例

Result: 在两个数据集的多个跨目标和跨领域场景中评估，结果显示在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型上都取得了统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，证明了该方法在领域适应方面的有效性

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成，避免了传统回译方法的两步评估流程问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法，将生成的手语先识别回文本再用文本指标比较，这种方法无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（如面部表情、空间语法、韵律），且难以确定错误来源。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore语义感知嵌入评估指标，在联合嵌入空间中直接评估手语生成，能够处理语义和韵律变化。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore实现了近乎完美的正确与随机对区分（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore为手语生成评估提供了更准确、语义感知的解决方案，解决了传统回译方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估框架，用于系统性评估视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型与人类行为存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型评测主要集中在单轮或问答场景，而基础设置是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。

Method: 提出四个指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和人类相似度）来评估VLM在交互式基础中的表现，在150个自我对战游戏会话中测试三个专有VLM并与人类对比。

Result: 三个模型都在至少三个指标上呈现出与人类模式的分差，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。发现任务成功得分不能表示成功基础，高图像-语句对齐也不一定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件和发现为未来VLM基础研究提供了一个框架，强调了在交互式场景中评估模型表现的重要性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide评估框架，解决大语言模型文档级机器翻译中句子不对齐的评估问题，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估实现准确的多粒度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文档级机器翻译中产生整篇文档输出，但现有评估方法假设句子级对齐，无法有效评估超长文档翻译质量。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）Align阶段自动推断源-目标句子对应关系并重建目标文本；2）n-Chunk滑动评估阶段计算1-4个块的平均指标分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达0.929，在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致。产生的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了准确、鲁棒且可操作的评估工具，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NE-PADD是一个利用命名实体知识进行部分音频深度伪造检测的新方法，通过语音命名实体识别和PADD双分支结构，结合注意力融合和注意力转移机制，在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子级音频深度伪造检测无法定位伪造位置，而部分音频深度伪造检测需要帧级定位。现有方法在利用音频语义信息，特别是命名实体方面研究不足。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD。采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导PADD。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法，证明了整合命名实体知识在PADD中的有效性。

Conclusion: NE-PADD成功地将命名实体知识整合到部分音频深度伪造检测中，通过双分支结构和注意力机制显著提升了检测性能，为音频伪造检测提供了新的语义信息利用途径。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Drivelology（废话学）概念，指语法连贯但语用矛盾、情感丰富或修辞颠覆的语言现象。研究发现当前大语言模型无法理解这种深层语义，构建了1200+多语言数据集进行测试，结果显示LLMs存在明显的语用理解局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然在许多NLP任务上表现出色，但对于语法连贯但语用复杂的"废话学"文本理解存在明显不足，需要探究模型在深层语义理解方面的局限性。

Method: 构建包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言（英、中、西、法、日、韩）Drivelology示例数据集，经过多轮专家评审和裁决。评估多种LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs经常将Drivelology与浅层无意义文本混淆，产生不连贯的论证，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能，显示出在语用理解方面存在深层的表征差距。

Conclusion: 统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解能力，LLMs在语用理解方面存在根本性局限，需要开发能够超越表面连贯性的深度语言理解模型。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了长链推理技术对语言模型可信过性的影响，从真实性、安全性、稳健性、公平性和隐私性五个核心维度进行了系统分析，指出虽然推理技术有助于提升模型可信过性，但前沿推理模型本身也存在相应的漏洞和风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然长链推理技术提升了LLM的性能，但对其如何影响语言模型可信过性的理解仍不充分，需要系统性的评估和分析。

Method: 调查最新的推理模型和CoT技术研究，从真实性、安全性、稳健性、公平性和隐私性五个维度进行结构化分析，提供方法论、发现和限制的详细分析。

Result: 推理技术通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提高稳健性来增强模型可信过性，但前沿推理模型本身在安全性、稳健性和隐私性方面存在相当或更大的漏洞。

Conclusion: 这份综述为AI安全社区提供了有价值的资源，帮助了解推理可信过性领域的最新进展，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了基于探针方法检测LLM有害指令的范式，发现这些方法学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性，存在虚假的安全感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令带来安全隐患，现有研究使用探针方法检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外数据上表现不佳，怀疑其学习的是表面模式而非语义理解

Method: 通过对照实验验证假设：首先比较简单n-gram方法与探针方法的性能，然后使用语义清洗的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认探针方法学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义危害性，在分布外数据上表现较差

Conclusion: 当前基于探针的方法存在虚假安全感，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的安全研究提供方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG组件解决现有移动代理的三大问题：LLM理解错误、缺乏环境交互和记忆能力缺失，在复杂移动任务上比现有方法提升10.3%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM移动代理存在三个主要问题：1)过度依赖LLM理解能力导致操作错误和步骤遗漏 2)缺乏外部环境交互，当应用无法满足查询时任务终止 3)缺乏记忆能力，每次指令都需要重建界面且无法从错误中学习

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含三个RAG增强组件：InterRAG用于快速准确识别用户查询，LocalRAG处理复杂长序列移动任务，MemRAG提供记忆能力。同时构建MobileRAG-Eval基准测试来评估性能

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试上，MobileRAG能够轻松处理真实世界移动任务，相比最先进方法性能提升10.3%，且操作步骤更少

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了当前移动代理的关键限制，在复杂移动任务处理方面表现出色，为移动自动化提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Result: 在4个常用数据集上的F1和EM指标超过最新方法，推理时间仅为基准方法的14.4%

Conclusion: MoT框架通过高效的矩阵思维结构和知识纠正机制，显著提升了复杂问题回答的准确性和效率

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得显著进展，但诗歌特别是韩语诗歌由于其比喻性语言和文化特异性，仍然缺乏充分研究，需要专门的数据集和模型

Method: 构建多标签情感数据集（7,662条目），采用最先进的韩语语言模型进行顺序微调：先在通用语料上预训练，再在KPoEM数据集上微调

Result: KPoEM模型显著优于先前模型，F1-micro达到0.60（相比通用语料训练的0.34），能够准确识别时空和文化特定的情感表达，同时保留现代韩语诗歌的核心情感

Conclusion: 该研究架起了计算方法与文学分析之间的桥梁，通过结构化数据为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能性，忠实保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

### [29] [SPFT-SQL: Enhancing Large Language Model for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Self-Play Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03937)
*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动的损失函数，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性，无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证驱动的迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈合成高质量微调数据；2）自博弈阶段使用错误驱动损失方法，激励对手模型的错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL通过针对性的自博弈微调策略，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，为SQL生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽视了语音中的副语言特征；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM为每个角色系统性地构建多维角色档案，从而创建VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 基于VoxRole基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个综合性基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CANDY是一个评估大语言模型中文事实核查能力的基准，包含约2万个标注实例。研究发现当前LLMs在事实核查方面存在局限，即使使用思维链和少样本提示，仍常产生事实捏造等错误。但LLMs作为辅助工具可显著提升人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型被越来越多地用于事实核查，但其在中文错误信息核查方面的有效性仍不确定，需要系统性的评估基准。

Method: 构建CANDY基准数据集（约20k标注实例），使用思维链推理和少样本提示技术评估LLMs，并开发分类法分析错误解释类型。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，事实捏造是最常见的失败模式。但作为辅助工具时能显著提升人类表现。

Conclusion: LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠，但作为人类辅助工具具有巨大潜力。CANDY数据集和代码已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Method: 利用少量并行拉丁语-意大利语句对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据创建合成数据集，并采用严格过滤咄反向翻译确保语言质量

Result: 合成数据集导致机器翻译训练的显著改善，超越现有意大利语-拉丁语翻译基线

Conclusion: 成功为拉丁语创建了首个公开情感分析咄多选题答案数据集，为该稀有语言的NLP研究咄应用奠定了基础

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时态知识图问答方法在处理复杂时态查询时的限制，包括缺乏复杂时态约束处理能力、推理能力不足以及分解框架中的错误传播问题。

Method: 设计了三个核心组件：时态问题分解器（递归将问题分解为子问题）、递归求解器（使用LLM和TKG知识底向上解决子问题）和答案聚合器（多路径聚合提高故障容锐性）。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA标准数据集上进行实验，在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别中显著提高了Hits@1指标，超过了最先进方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归思维和无需训练的方式，有效提升了时态知识图问答的性能，特别是在处理复杂时态查询旹显示出优势。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在现实应用中面对语言变异性时的鲁棒性，检验基准测试评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 系统性地生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，测试34个不同规模和性能的最先进LLM在这些改写问题上的表现变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入上的排名相对稳定，但绝对性能得分显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 基准测试评估方法存在局限性，需要开发能够更好反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the

practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，整合两种特征能带来显著性能提升

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个多智能体框架，用于生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据，通过分解咨询任务到专门的LLM智能体来模拟真实咨询结构，显著提升了生成会话的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门模拟关键心理技术的LLM智能体处理。同时提出了统一的评估框架，包含9个方面的专家评估。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%、CBT特定技能4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT数据微调的模型性能提升6.3%-7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架有效解决了高质量心理咨询数据稀缺问题，通过多智能体方法更好地模拟真实咨询过程，为心理咨询LLM的微调提供了优质数据源，推动了可扩展心理咨询的发展。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的双重增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来解决标注数据稀缺问题，在两个Twitter数据集上显著提升了F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且耗时，需要解决数据稀缺问题来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出双重增强框架：1）显式文本增强使用大语言模型通过5种生成策略增强文本信息；2）隐式特征空间增强设计5种新颖的扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作以保持语义和关系属性。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架通过双重增强有效提升了社交媒体事件检测的性能，解决了标注数据稀缺问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性

Method: 构建包含1012个中英文问题的数据集，涵盖8类反直觉挑战，采用人类参与的流水线和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在对抗性指令下表现不佳，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性可能导致提供过时的医学建议，存在安全隐患。需要系统评估LLMs处理医学知识更新的能力。

Method: 构建了两个新颖的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，专门针对医学共识随时间变化的案例）。评估了8个主流LLM在这些数据集上的表现。

Result: 所有评估的LLM都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，无法有效处理医学共识变化的情况。分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这种现象的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在医学知识更新方面的重要局限性，为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了未来缓解这一问题的方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO方法通过音素增强编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升了上下文ASR系统在特定领域命名实体识别上的性能，特别是在处理同音词和多词实体方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在处理领域特定命名实体（尤其是同音词）时表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限而难以捕捉细粒度音素变化，且现有方法将实体视为独立标记导致多词偏置不完整。

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，并在不确定性下减少误报。

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项下），显著优于基线方法。在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健的性能提升。

Conclusion: PARCO通过综合的音素增强和实体消歧技术，有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，特别是在处理同音词和多词实体方面取得了显著改进，展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，即使微小的提示词改变也能显著影响偏见测量结果，有时甚至完全反转偏见方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。当前评估方法通常使用与自然语言分布不同的任务提示，可能通过显性或隐性信号提示性别偏见相关内容的存在，这引发了关于评估方法有效性的疑问。

Method: 研究测试了在不同提示条件下的模型表现：(1)使测试情境显著化，(2)使性别相关内容显著化。使用四种任务格式，结合token概率和离散选择两种度量方法进行评估。

Result: 即使微小的提示词改变也能显著改变偏见结果，有时甚至完全反转偏见方向。离散选择度量方法倾向于比概率度量放大偏见程度。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试和开发社区提出了新问题：受控测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"表现，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了开源语言模型在日本历法处理能力，发现即使日语中心模型也在日历运算和多历法一致性方面表现差强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于公历，而许多非公历系统如日本历、希吉来历等仍在活跃使用，但语言模型在这些文化特定历法的处理能力未经评估

Method: 构建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行系统性评测

Result: 发现部分模型能够进行历法转换，但即使日语中心模型也在日本历算术运算和不同历法之间的一致性维持方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Motivation: 现有MAE方法将重建目标限制在原始关节坐标或简单变体，导致计算冗余和语义表征能力有限

Method: 提出协同学习框架，通过轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化的监督信号，采用约束优化确保特征多样性和防止模型崩溃

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD数据集上验证：计算效率提升6.2倍，表征质量优秀，在多丫下游任务中达到最高水平

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测替代传统低级重建，有效提升了自监督骨架动作识别的效率和性能

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于UNet分割背链的教师-学生模型，通过对比表征学习和域对抗训练来解决有线形态检测中的域偏移和数据不平衡问题，在有线形态检测和非典型有线分类任务中取得了良好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将分割基础的检测和分类集成到统一框架中，有效地提高了有线形态分析的健壮性和性能。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调来解决多偏差问题，无需测试时组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升了最差组准确率和降低了偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的性能和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 1. 自适应偏差集成学习（ABIL）：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器显式识别偏差；2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有偏差的紧凑网络。还提出了Scaled Bias Amplification（SBA）指标来处理子组不平衡和分布偏移问题。

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证，提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并在SBA指标上达到新低，即使偏差复杂度和分布偏移加剧。

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多偏差视觉识别解决方案，能够有效处理现实世界中的多重偏差问题。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过消融研究优化了nnU-Net模型，发展出了轻量级U-Net网络，在保持心臀分割精度的同时大大缩小模型规模和提高速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心臀分割任务上表现良好，但模型过大过慢，限制了实时应用的可能性。需要找到最有效的组件来构建更简洁高效的模型。

Method: 进行系统性的消融研究，逐步评估数据增帽方案、网络架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术。基于消融结果设计了轻量级U-Net模型。

Result: 新模型参数量从33M降到2M，速度提升4倍，在CAMUS数据集上分割性能与nnU-Net统计学上等效（Dice分数左室/肌肉/左房为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），跨数据集验证也显示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帽和深度监督是关键因素，而复杂增帽和大模型容量带来的收益逐渐减少。通过精心选择最重要的组件，可以构建高效轻量的医学图像分割模型。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有V2X协同感知研究主要关注精度指标，忽视了效率、延迟和实际部署等系统级考量。全精度模型计算和传输成本高，难以在资源受限环境中实时运行。

Method: 提出QuantV2X系统，采用统一的端到端量化策略，对神经网络模型和传输消息表示同时进行低比特量化，减少计算负载和传输带宽。

Result: 在低比特约束下达到与全精度系统相当的精度，系统级延迟减少3.2倍，mAP30提升9.5，能更有效地扩展模型规模以适应严格内存预算。

Conclusion: 完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中具有可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构以捕捉空间关系，图比较在搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用中至关重要。现有最成功的图匹配方法依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，在联合嵌入架构的末尾才进行跨图节点级交互，使用可微分图核作为最终学习到的节点级嵌入的距离函数

Result: LayoutGKN在计算相似性方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN通过延迟跨图交互和使用图核距离函数，实现了高效且准确的图相似性计算，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种基于奇异值分解的多模态参数高效适配方法，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来实现领域适配，仅需0.04%的参数就能达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适配方法依赖提示工程和全模型微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识，需要更高效的适配技术。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调奇异值来重新缩放基向量，不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越且可解释的CLIP适配方法，能更好地保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确农业和植物病害诊断对全球食品安全至关重要，但现有轻量级网络使用通用的注意机制，无法有效捕捉植物病害的缩微特征(如不规则痕痕形状和复杂纹理)，导致在边缘设备上部署高精度模型遇到挑战。

Method: 1. 使用训练免费的神经网络架构搜索方法(DeepMAD)构建高效的边缘设备网络背骨
2. 提出形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)，将注意力分解为两个分支：一个使用可变形卷积(DCNv4)实现形状感知，另一个使用Gabor滤波器实现纹理感知

Result: 在公开的CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型(仅需401K参数和51.1M FLOPs)达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。分离实验确认STAM在性能上显著超过了基线模型和标准注意力模型。

Conclusion: 通过基于领域知识的解耦注意力机制，为边缘部署的精确农业AI提供了一条有前景的路径。该方法能够有效捕捉植物病害的特定特征，并在轻量化模型中实现高精度诊断。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重阻碍。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement(GAE)模块和Localization Guidance Branch(LGB)，通过多尺度监督解码器(MSSD)生成更准确的预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验证实SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并显示出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化性。

Conclusion: SLENet为水下伪装目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个数据集上表现出卓越性能，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

TL;DR: 提出利用视频时序信息改进扩散模型训练的方法，无需修改架构即可加速收敛并提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在独立静态图像上训练，无法充分利用时序信息，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和泛化能力差

Method: 利用连续视频帧中的时序归纳偏置作为训练策略，无需修改模型架构即可集成到标准扩散训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上收敛速度提升2倍以上，训练和验证分布的FID指标更低，生成多样性更好

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少梯度方差加速收敛，能有效捕捉有意义的时序变化，提升扩散模型性能

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误在临床实践中普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中需要检查数百个切片，现有模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告需求。

Method: 采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像-文本对齐，使用语言模型重写和放射学语义匹配库来处理报告变异性。

Result: 在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测方面表现良好。

Conclusion: MedVista3D框架有效解决了3D CT分析中的关键挑战，为放射诊断提供了更准确的局部-全局理解和语义一致的报告生成能力。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL能够学习更具判别性的文本提示，有效提升CLIP在细粒度识别任务上的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: 事件模态的引入为激光渥除任务带来了巨大的效率优势，显示了高效稀疏异步成像机制在解决激光问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba是一种RGB-Event检测方法，通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化和跨模态聚焦融合，自适应地丢弃低信息区域，在准确性和效率之间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-Event检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域（图像背景和事件数据的非事件区域）时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。现有token稀疏化方法使用固定数量或阈值进行token选择，无法适应不同复杂度样本的信息保留需求。

Method: 提出FocusMamba方法：1）事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略，利用事件相机感知的场景内容变化识别并自适应丢弃各模态中的低信息区域；2）跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块，基于稀疏化结果有效捕获和整合两种模态的互补特征。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效互补信息整合，成功解决了RGB-Event检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了性能与效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

TL;DR: OccTENS是一个生成式占用世界模型，通过时间下一尺度预测任务解决长期占用生成中的效率、时间退化和可控性问题，在占用质量和推理速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Method: 将占用世界模型重新表述为时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，使用TensFormer管理时间因果关系和空间关系，并提出整体姿态聚合策略实现占用和自运动的统一序列建模。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间上都优于最先进的方法，实现了高质量、高效率的长期占用生成。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间下一尺度预测框架和姿态控制策略，成功解决了占用世界建模中的关键挑战，为可控、高保真的3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督学习方法，利用视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件，结合密集对比学习来建立密集功能对应关系，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系对于形状重建和机器人操作等任务至关重要。物体功能（即物体对其他物体的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的对象部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 提出弱监督学习范式：1）利用视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件；2）结合密集对比学习从像素对应关系中提取功能和空间知识；3）将知识蒸馏到新模型中建立密集功能对应关系。

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法优于基于现成自监督图像表示和接地视觉语言模型的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于功能相似性的密集对应关系建立方法是有效的，视觉语言模型和密集对比学习的结合能够成功提取功能和空间知识，为跨类别物体对应关系提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attn-Adapter是一个在线少样本学习框架，通过双重注意力机制增强CLIP的适应性，无需重新训练基础模型即可实现动态适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型在零样本图像识别方面表现出色，但在少样本场景下面临计算密集型离线微调的挑战，容易过拟合

Method: 提出双注意力机制：Memory Attn-Adapter利用支持样本优化类别嵌入，Local-Global Attn-Adapter通过整合局部和全局特征丰富图像嵌入

Result: 在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理并在不同CLIP骨干网络上具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter框架有效解决了CLIP在少样本学习中的适应性问题，实现了无需重新训练的动态在线适应

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调细节准确性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示相似性的指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM-based指标虽然相关性强但过于昂贵，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用。

Method: 改进CLIP模型，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性 - 奖励正确细节并惩罚错误细节，构建SPECS指标。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，适合在图像描述模型开发中进行迭代检查点评估。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个实用高效的替代方案，解决了长图像描述评估中现有指标的局限性，平衡了准确性和计算效率的需求。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域缺乏高质量标注的多样化医学图像数据，这限制了可靠AI模型的开发。虽然自然图像的生成基础模型已有显著进展，但医学图像生成仍面临挑战。

Method: 基于潜在扩散变换器架构，在96万张胸部X光片-报告对的最大数据集上进行预训练，开发了统一的文本、掩码和边界框引导合成框架。

Result: 通过专家评估和定量指标验证了准确的X光片合成能力，在数据增强和监督预训练方面表现出色，使用少量训练数据就能提升疾病分类、检测和分割任务的性能。

Conclusion: 生成式基础模型在构建更准确、数据高效和公平的医疗AI系统中具有变革性作用，能够创建多样化患者队列来检测和缓解人口统计偏差。

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体视频的关键数据源，但数据量巨大带来存储和传输挑战。现有深度学习视频编码主要关注单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足。

Method: 提出特征级视角间运动矢量预测方法，利用解码的独立视角运动特征条件化依赖视角运动编码；提出无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，从独立视角内容特征预测视角间上下文；配合相应的视角间熵模型学习先验知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的LMVC框架大幅优于传统MV-HEVC标准的参考软件，为未来研究建立了强基线。

Conclusion: 该工作成功实现了端到端学习的多视角视频编码，确保了随机访问和向后兼容性，同时显著提升了压缩效率，为多视角视频编码领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学管状结构重建方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持续同调约束有潜力，但通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局拓扑保持和推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: TopoSculpt采用：(i)整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；(ii)首次引入拓扑完整性Betti约束，联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；(iii)使用持续同调的课程精炼方案，从粗到细逐步修正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上的实验显示显著改进：β₀错误从69.00降至3.40（气道）和1.65降至0.30（CoW），树长度检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效修正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑重建方面都有实质性改进。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Motivation: 气胸在胸片中可能表现细微，需要自动化工具辅助放射科医生进行准确检测，避免漏诊危及生命的情况

Method: 使用U-Net架构配合EfficientNet-B4编码器，在SIIM-ACR数据集上进行训练，采用数据增强技术和二元交叉熵加Dice损失的组合损失函数

Result: 在独立PTX-498测试集上取得了IoU 0.7008和Dice分数0.8241的优秀性能

Conclusion: 该深度学习模型能够准确定位气胸区域，为放射科医生提供有效的辅助诊断支持

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力，通过生成表达性负样本来增强OOD检测性能，在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95达4.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假负标签会严重降低近OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLMs识别可能为OOD的样本并生成描述性负句子，针对近OOD场景生成视觉相似的负标签，设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上FPR95降低4.2%，达到新的SOTA水平，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs的推理能力有效构建负文本空间，显著提升OOD检测性能，特别是在近OOD和远OOD场景下都表现出色

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖单一图像模态，在光照和噪声干扰下特征表示有限，变化模式建模和泛化能力不足，需要多模态信息来增强性能。

Method: 提出MMChange框架：1）图像特征细化模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2）使用视觉语言模型生成双时相图像的语义描述；3）文本差异增强模块捕获细粒度语义变化；4）图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD三个数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态方法通过结合图像和文本信息，显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能，为解决光照和噪声干扰下的检测挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息编码和实例相关性计算的问题，特别是处理训练和测试序列长度不同的外推问题，同时避免Transformer方法需要定制CUDA内核的复杂性

Method: 包含位置编码模块（利用实例坐标而非序列索引编码空间关系）和SAC块（基于MLP的全实例相关性计算，具有线性时间复杂度）

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL提供了一种高效且易于部署的WSI分类方法，通过空间感知和线性复杂度的相关性计算，在多个基准数据集上表现出优异性能

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Method: 多任务学习框架，利用训练时可用的配对原生和对比增强MRI数据（有/无血管标注）进行模型训练

Conclusion: 辅助信息成像模态可以增强专家标注，即使仅在训练时可用，该方法在不同领域（如脑肿瘤分割）也证实有效

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为最佳性能往往通过精心选择的提示词获得，需要系统评估提示词敏感性。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示词类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂提示词能力较差，提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示词设计原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，提示词敏感性是评估大型多模态模型性能的重要维度。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力对所有高度层赋予相同权重，限制了不同高度特征的表达能力

Method: 使用全局和局部垂直切片提取体素特征，提出全局局部融合模块协调细节与上下文信息，设计SEAttention3D模块为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上显著提升平均IoU，特别是在小物体类别上表现突出

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过有效利用高度轴信息和动态通道注意力机制，显著提升了3D语义占据预测的性能

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Conclusion: 研究为偏偏相关检测提供了新方法，并在真实医学场景（侵入性乳腺癌分类）中进行了验证，建议在未来研究中谨慎使用包含偏偏信号的图像。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的新问题，所提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能有效解决该问题，提高学习效果

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案，具有低延迟高精度特点。

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Conclusion: 该无监督重排名方法通过多视角特征聚合有效减少视角偏差，在保持高效的同时显著提升了人员重识别的准确性，适用于大规模数据集

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Result: 在两个基准数据集LLP和UnAV-100上的多个关键指标中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 结合两种研究方向的优势，通过语义净化和精确传播解决了现有方法的错误放大问题

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related

three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations

controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0

Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面存在困难，导致伪影生成和故事叙述不连贯，需要一种能够保持多角色一致交互的新方法。

Method: 使用预训练LLM通过上下文学习生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话；采用基于边界注意力的每框掩码技术控制角色交互；应用身份一致的自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性；使用区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置；通过CLIPSeg渲染对话气泡并分配给角色。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion通过创新的迭代框架和注意力机制，有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的一致性和对话分配问题，为文本到故事生成提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法为在稀疏视角和无相机监督的关节对象表征学习提供了有效解决方案，拓展了该领域的应用可能性

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context

state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合作为密集几何预测任务的微调基础，FE2E框架通过有效的适配策略成功实现了这一目标，展示了编辑模型在密集预测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and

viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生结构更清晰、视觉更协调、艺术性更丰富的3D风格化效果，有效解决了现有方法的限制。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtyINR是一种自监督神经网络框架，通过连续神经表示同时重建物体和探针，无需探针预表征，在低信号条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代方法和深度学习在X射线叠层成像中，特别是在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下，对未知探针的图像重建效果不佳，限制了该技术的广泛应用。

Method: 提出Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR)框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需探针预表征。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了卓越的重建质量，在挑战性低信号条件下表现出显著的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息化的框架，适用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的风险导向数据集构建方法无法覆盖越来越复杂的真实世界多模态安全场景，且缺乏统一的评估指标来验证其整体效果。

Method: 提出基于图像的自适应数据集构建方法，从图像出发构建配对的文本和指导响应，自动生成35k图像-文本对的RMS数据集，并通过微调安全判断模型来评估数据集效果。

Result: 在多种任务上进行了广泛实验，证明了图像导向方法的效果性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究为真实世界多模态安全数据集的构建提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

TL;DR: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching和Velocity Distillation两种优化目标，将25步采样的3D流模型蒸馏为1-2步，实现9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高质量生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，一致性模型在2D扩散加速方面取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍待探索，需要开发高效的少步蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching(VM)学习师生模型的稳定速度场匹配，以及Velocity Distillation(VD)利用学习到的速度场进行概率密度蒸馏，将边缘数据传输目标转化为可优化的速度和分布级别目标。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25减少到1-2步，实现0.68秒(1步×2)和0.94秒(2步×2)的延迟，在A800上分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能，为高效3D生成提供了有效的蒸馏解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在肖像动画生成中难以实现高保真度、空间一致的属性迁移，特别是在零样本设置下处理多样化属性和参考组合的挑战。

Method: 采用双参考网络将肖像和属性图像的空间特征注入扩散模型去噪过程，使用自重建训练策略，结合掩码扩展和空间/外观级数据增强来提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络架构和训练策略，成功实现了零样本肖像动画生成，为面部属性迁移提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用凶光的多边形几何特征，通过深度学习统计形状约束实现精确检测，而且不受到边界数量的限制

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了UCF-UM评估框架，通过周期性的图像-文本-图像轮换来量化统一模型在视觉理解和生成之间的语义潮淀，补充了传统单次评测的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法将视觉理解(I2T)和生成(T2I)能力分离考察，无法反映模型在两种模态间轮换时的语义一致性和稳定性。

Method: 设计了UCF-UM周期评估协议，通过多轮I2T和T2I交互来量化语义潮淀，包括MCD(平均累积潮淀)、SDR(语义潮淀率)和MGG(多代生成评估)三个指标。构建了ND400新标准数据集。

Result: 在7个最新模型上进行评测，发现不同模型的跨模态稳定性存在显著差异：BAGEL模型能在多轮交互中保持语义，而Vila-u模型虽然单次评测成绩优秀但潮淀快速。

Conclusion: 周期一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评测的必要补充，UCF-UM框架为评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表征强度提供了实用的量化指标。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing

lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and

challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story

Conclusion: 联合训练不同失真类型促进了知识共享，显著提升了模型在多模态虚假信息检测中的泛化能力和性能

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Conclusion: LuxDiT通过结合扩散Transformer和精心设计的训练策略，成功解决了单图像/视频光照估计的挑战，在真实场景中展现出良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯分布技术需要大量高斯分布来实现高质量表示，但这会显著增加GPU内存消耗并降低训练/渲染效率。现有码书压缩方法只能用于已训练模型，无法直接用于训练过程。

Method: 提出ContraGS方法，使用码书紧凑存储高斯参数向量，将参数估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，通过MCMC采样在压缩表示的后验分布上进行采样。

Result: ContraGS平均减少3.49倍训练峰值内存，加速训练1.36倍和渲染1.88倍，同时保持接近SOTA的模型质量。

Conclusion: ContraGS成功解决了在码书压缩表示上直接训练的挑战，实现了内存效率、训练速度和模型质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Motivation: 现有方法多假设均质媒介，缺乏异质散射参数的明确分布模型，Perlin噪声在模拟自然表面复杂异质性方面有效

Method: 创建HeteroSynth合成数据集，用Fractal Perlin噪声模拟异质散射参数，提出TensoIS学习框架，使用可学习低秩张量分解表示3D散射参数体积

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Method: 提出了一种基于推理-组合-生成的新视角，使用体部文本空间作为中间表示，开发了细调的LLM(SMooGPT)来执行推理、组合和生成任务

Conclusion: 综合实验、评估和用户感知研究证明了该方法的有效性，特别是在纯文本驱动的风格化运动生成任务中

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了个人特定渲染的高照相实性和生成式建模的普适性，能够生成具有实时控制能力和现实姿势依赖变形的高质量人类虚拟人。

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面仍然容易出错，缺乏人类类似的稳健心理表征，需要引入具身认知结构来改进推理能力。

Method: 开发了Embodied-LM神经符号系统，基于源自感知运动经验的图像模式构建图式表征，使用答案集编程（ASP）进行声明式空间推理操作化。

Result: 实验证明LLM能够通过具身认知结构解释场景，这些结构可形式化为可执行程序，生成的表征支持有效的逻辑推理并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现专注于空间原语，但为纳入更复杂动态表征奠定了计算基础，展示了神经符号方法在改善LLM推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升大语言模型复杂推理能力方面效果显著，但其成功背后的机制仍然不明确，需要深入理解RL训练过程中的关键现象和动态。

Method: 通过分析RL训练过程中的现象，发现推理层次结构的存在，并提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，专注于优化高层策略规划token。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于现有基线方法，验证了语义熵作为衡量策略探索的优越指标。

Conclusion: 聚焦策略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键，语义熵比token级熵等误导性指标更能有效衡量策略探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Motivation: 理解LLM是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，现有研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证。

Method: 从三个维度系统分析LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质配置的动态演变；(2)自我报告特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)人格注入等干预措施对自我报告和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自我报告特质无法可靠预测行为，人格注入能成功引导自我报告但对实际行为影响有限或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入的评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Motivation: 传统的到字符级RL框架与多步推理过程的本质不匹配，存在理论空白，需要一种更适合推理级别特征的理论框架。

Method: 提出CoT-Space框架，将LLM推理重构为连续语义空间中的优化过程，从噪声视角和风险视角分析这一过程，并进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明，最佳CoT长度的收敛是过拟合与不足拟合之间基本交换的自然结果，实验结果强烈支持理论发现。

Conclusion: CoT-Space框架不仅能解释过思等实验现象，为推理机器人的未来发展提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 动态更新记忆在测试时优于固定记忆设置，支持通过解决更多问题和抽象更多模式实现自我改进的假设。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Conclusion: LibriQuote数据集为表达性TTS研究提供了有价值的资源，展示了大规模表达性语音数据对提升TTS性能的重要性，同时指出了当前系统在表达性合成方面的局限性

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature

### [137] [Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Adversarial Evidence in the Health Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03787)
*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了医疗领域中检索增强生成(RAG)系统的稳健性，发现对投攻性文档敏感，但当检索池中包含有用证据时可保持稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估RAG系统在医疗领域的稳健性，因为该领域错误回答可能造成严重害害，且有可靠的真相证据供对照

Method: 使用常见健康问题进行受控实验，变化检索文档类型(有用、有害、对抗性)和问题框架方式(一致、中立、不一致)，分析模型输出与真相答案的一致性

Result: 对抗性文档显著降低了模型输出与真相的一致性，但当检索池中同时包含有用证据时，稳健性可以得以保持

Conclusion: 研究结果为高风险领域设计更安全的RAG系统提供了可操作的见解，强调了对检索安全保障措施的需求

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

*Or Shachar,Uri Katz,Yoav Goldberg,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NER Retriever是一个零样本检索框架，使用LLM内部表示而非顶层嵌入来编码实体和类型描述，通过轻量级对比投影网络实现类型感知的实体检索，在三个基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统命名实体识别需要预定义类型模式的问题，实现基于用户自定义类型描述的可扩展、无模式的实体检索。

Method: 利用LLM中间层transformer块的值向量编码实体提及和类型描述，训练对比投影网络对齐类型兼容实体并分离不相关类型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著优于词汇和密集句子级检索基线方法，证明内部表示比常用顶层嵌入更有效地编码细粒度类型信息。

Conclusion: 为LLM内部表示选择提供了实证支持，展示了可扩展、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案，代码库已公开。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种本地到全局的图像检索范式，通过结合高效本地特征检索和全局特征重排序，实现了更好的图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的全局到本地检索范式在找到部分匹配时效果屏录，而新兴的高效本地特征检索技术为改变这种局限提供了可能。

Method: 提出了一种重排序方法，在本地特征检索相似性的基础上动态计算全局特征，利用多维尺度缩放技术创建嵌入表征。

Result: 在Revisited Oxford和Paris数据集上达到了新的state-of-the-art结果，显示了坚固的检索性能。

Conclusion: 本地到全局的检索范式通过结合高效本地特征检索和有效全局特征重排序，实现了更优称的图像检索性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为运动障碍患者在非结构化环境中提供抓握辅助，这些环境中物体类别和用户意图多样且不可预测，需要增强泛化能力。

Method: 采用分层控制框架，集成视觉-语言基础模型和开放词汇机制，实现零样本检测未见过的物体；多模态决策器融合空间和语言线索推断用户意图。

Result: 在15个物体和三种抓握类型上进行系统评估，10名参与者的实验结果显示抓握能力得分达到87.00%，优于最先进的基线方法，并改善了与自然手部运动的运动学对齐。

Conclusion: OVGrasp框架通过多模态集成和开放词汇机制，有效提升了在开放环境中对未见物体的抓握辅助性能，为运动障碍患者的自主性恢复提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人灵巧操作数据收集的挑战，传统遥操作方式效率低且不自然，需要一种能够最大化人类操作数据向机器人转移能力的新范式。

Method: 开发DEXOP被动手部外骨骼，机械连接人类和机器人手指，提供直接接触反馈和姿态镜像，在自然环境中收集丰富的视觉+触觉数据。

Result: DEXOP在多种灵巧接触任务中表现出色，相比遥操作显著提高了数据收集速度和质量，学习到的策略在单位时间数据收集量上表现更优。

Conclusion: DEXOP是推进机器人灵巧操作能力的强大工具，通过perioperation范式实现了高效、自然的人类操作数据收集和向机器人的技能转移。

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 人们与偏见AI协作时，会受到AI种族偏见的显著影响，即使认为AI建议质量低也会偏向选择AI偏好的种族群体。完成隐性联想测试(IAT)可以减少这13%的偏见行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人们在与具有种族偏见的AI系统协作时的行为变化，以及隐性联想测试在人工智能-人循环决策中的作用。

Method: 进行简历筛选实验(N=528)，使用模拟具有种族偏见的AI模型，评估16种高低地位职业的候选人。通过名字和群体关联代表不同种族，在1,526个场景中测量偏见行为，并使用IAT测量无意识联想。

Result: 与无偏见AI协作时，人们选择各种族候选人的比例相等。但与偏向某种族的AI协作时，人们偏向选择该种族候选人的比例可达90%。完成IAT后，选择不符合种族-地位定型候选人的概率提高13%。

Conclusion: 人们在AI-人循环决策中的自主性受到挑战，组织和监管政策需考虑AI-HITL决策的复杂性，并在系统实施、使用者教育和监管范围方面做出适应。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为上下文化词元区分（CTD）的新方法，用于改善语音搜索查询的拼写纠正效果。方法通过BERT生成上下文表征，构建组合层增强语义信息，并通过比较原始和上下文化表征来纠正错误词元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着由自动语音识别（ASR）系统驱动的语音搜索日益普及，查询拼写纠正成为现代搜索引擎的重要功能，需要有效帮助用户清晰表达意图。

Method: 采用BERT生成词元级别的上下文表征，构建组合层来增强语义信息，最终通过聚合词元表征生成正确查询，通过比较原始词元表征和上下文化表征来纠正错误词元。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在所有指标上都表现出优异性能，同时还提供了包含错误ASR转录的新基准数据集，为音频查询纠正提供了全面的评估。

Conclusion: CTD方法在语音查询拼写纠正任务上表现突出，为这一领域提供了有效的解决方案，并通过新的基准数据集提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

Motivation: 尽管自盛益语音模型在语音处理中表现突出，但对非语音数据的效果研究不足，本文研究这些模型在生物声音任务中的转移学习能力

Method: 使用HuBERT、WavLM、XEUS等语音模型生成动物声音的隐藏表征，通过线性探测分析时间平均表征，并扩展方法考虑时间信息影响，研究频率范围和噪声对性能的影响

Result: 语音模型能够为不同分类群的动物声音生成丰富的表征，结果与精细调整的生物声音预训练模型相当，并显示了噪声稳健预训练设置的重要性

Conclusion: 语音基础的自盛益学习作为一种高效框架，具有推动生物声音研究发展的巨大潜力

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的语言模型后训练主要使用在线数据（模型生成）和离线数据（人类演示），分别对应RL和SFT方法。本文旨在证明这两种方法不是对立的，而是同一优化过程的不同实例

Method: 推导了统一策略梯度估计器，将各种后训练方法表示为不同数据分布假设下的共同目标梯度。提出了混合后训练算法HPT，动态选择不同训练信号

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和两个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上都 consistently 超越强基线

Conclusion: RL和SFT方法可以统一在一个理论框架下，HPT算法能够有效利用演示数据并保持稳定探索，不牺牲已学习的推理模式

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

<details>

Motivation: 开源LLM社区产生了大量微调模型，但由于元数据不一致和存储库非结构化，导航和理解这些模型变得困难，需要一种统一的方法来表征和比较不同微调模型。

Method: 提出Delta Activations方法，通过计算微调模型与基础模型在相同输入下的内部激活差异，将模型表示为向量嵌入。这种方法对不同的微调设置具有鲁棒性，并展现出加性特性。

Result: Delta Activations能够有效按领域和任务对模型进行聚类，揭示模型景观的结构。同时支持通过少样本微调嵌入任务，并可用于模型选择和模型合并。

Conclusion: Delta Activations为理解和重用公开可用的微调模型提供了一种有效的方法，有望促进模型复用实践。代码已开源。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅具有实际性能优势，更重要的是强调了直接追踪梯度动态的重要性，旨在弥合理论预期与实证行为之间的差距，为未来优化研究提供见解。

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Conclusion: 该问题框架和方法可推广到卫星图像机器学习的各个应用领域，特别适用于增强聚集式农业调查数据的场景。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Conclusion: 该研究为量化感知知识萌萬中的数据增帽选择提供了一种有效的方法，通过优化上下文互信息来提升低位深度学习模型的性能，具有强大的实用价值和普遍适用性。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

Motivation: 解决生成模型中的根本困境：迭代扩散模型计算成本高，而高效少步替代方案存在质量上限。传统训练目标要么关注无限小动态，要么关注直接端点预测，限制了生成步数与输出质量的关系。

Method: 引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解析定义任意有限时间间隔内的状态转移，提出Transition Models (TiM)生成范式，适应任意步数转移，支持从单次跳跃到多步精细优化的无缝过渡。

Result: TiM仅用865M参数就实现了最先进性能，在所有评估步数上超越SD3.5(8B参数)和FLUX.1(12B参数)。随着采样预算增加，TiM展现出单调质量改进，在原生分辨率策略下支持高达4096x4096分辨率的卓越保真度。

Conclusion: TiM通过精确的连续时间动力学方程成功解决了生成模型中步数与质量的权衡问题，实现了参数效率与性能的突破，为生成模型提供了灵活且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.
