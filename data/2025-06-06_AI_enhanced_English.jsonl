However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad.

Conventional deep learning\nmethodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive\nsupervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news\nenvironments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language\nmodels (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately\ndetecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable\ndemonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative\nEmergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.\nThe C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power\nand SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning\nframework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a\nMixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based\ncontinue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without\nretraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets\ndemonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,\neffectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous\nemergent fake news scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces the C\u00b2EFND framework to improve fake news detection by combining LLMs' generalization and SLMs' expertise, addressing data scarcity and outdated knowledge.", "motivation": "Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts, and existing methods (SLMs and LLMs) struggle with adaptability and accuracy due to data scarcity and outdated knowledge.", "method": "Proposes C\u00b2EFND, a multi-round collaborative learning framework integrating LLMs and SLMs, with lifelong knowledge editing and replay-based continual learning.", "result": "Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show C\u00b2EFND outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.", "conclusion": "C\u00b2EFND effectively addresses fake news detection challenges by leveraging collaborative learning and continual updates, enhancing performance in dynamic environments."}}

Contrastive self-supervised\nand vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology\ndatasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative\nmodels, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a\ncompelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve\nsynthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling\nprivacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,\nsuch as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based\ngenerative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,\na vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\\&E-stained whole slide images\ncovering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a\nself-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without\nany annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across\nmultiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train\na self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between\ninstitutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case\nwith real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely\ncontrol image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be\nused for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell\nsegmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,\nimproving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to\nuse H\\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we\nuse this capability to infer IHC staining from H\\&E images.
