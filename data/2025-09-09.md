### [1] [An Empirical Analysis of Discrete Unit Representations in Speech Language Modeling Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05359)
*Yanis Labrak,Richard Dufour,Mickaël Rouvier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了语音语言模型中离散单元表示，探讨了模型架构、数据表示和训练鲁棒性对语音预训练阶段的影响，发现最优离散化策略随模型容量变化，并揭示了聚类数据选择对模型鲁棒性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音语言模型中离散单元表示如何优化语音建模，特别是在持续预训练阶段将现有预训练语言模型适配到语音模态的过程。

Method: 系统考察模型架构、数据表示和训练鲁棒性，通过实验分析语音编码器和聚类粒度在不同模型规模下的作用，研究聚类分布和音素对齐，探索离散词汇表的有效使用。

Result: 发现最优离散化策略随模型容量而变化，揭示了语言和副语言模式，证明了聚类数据选择中领域匹配对目标应用的重要性。

Conclusion: 离散单元表示在语音语言模型中具有重要作用，模型容量、聚类策略和领域匹配都是影响语音建模效果的关键因素，需要针对不同应用场景进行优化。

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

### [2] [Beyond ROUGE: N-Gram Subspace Features for LLM Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05360)
*Jerry Li,Evangelos Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于N-Gram频率张量的新题检测方法，通过张量分解提取特征，较传统基准提高了语言模型幻觉检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型幻觉问题严重，而传统指标如ROUGE、BERTScore等缺乏足够语义深度，无法有效检测幻觉内容

Method: 构建N-Gram频率张量来描述文本语义结构，通过张量分解提取奇异值特征，使用MLP分类器进行幻觉检测

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上表现显著优于传统基准方法，与最先进的LLM判断方法竞争性能相当

Conclusion: 张量基方法能够提供更丰富的语义表征，为语言模型幻觉检测开启了新方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

### [3] [A Lightweight Framework for Trigger-Guided LoRA-Based Self-Adaptation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05385)
*Jiacheng Wei,Faguo Wu,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个触发引导的动态微调框架，能够在推理时实现自适应更新，通过分解复杂推理任务为原子子任务来解决大语言模型无法在推理时持续学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据，这限制了它们在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: SAGE包含三个核心组件：触发模块（实时检测推理失败）、触发缓冲模块（使用HDBSCAN聚类异常样本并进行稳定性检查和相似性合并）、Lora存储模块（通过适配器池动态优化参数更新以实现知识保留）。

Result: 评估结果显示，SAGE在原子推理子任务上通过测试时的动态知识更新表现出优异的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架成功解决了大语言模型在推理时无法持续学习的问题，为复杂推理任务提供了有效的动态适应解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

### [4] [Talk Isn't Always Cheap: Understanding Failure Modes in Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05396)
*Andrea Wynn,Harsh Satija,Gillian Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多机器人辩论在模型能力异质的情况下可能导致性能下降，强模型也会被说服改变正确观点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型能力异质性对多机器人辩论动态和结果的影响，因为之前的研究仅关注同质性模型群

Method: 通过一系列实验分析模型在辩论过程中的行为变化，观察模型如何困于一致性而改变正确观点

Result: 辩论可能导致准确率随时间下降，即使强模型占多数也会被说服改变正确答案，模型更偏向于达成一致而非挑战错误推理

Conclusion: 多机器人辩论存在重要的失败模式，如果模型没有适当激励或能力来抵御说服力强但错误的推理，简单应用辩论可能造成性能退化

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

### [5] [No Translation Needed: Forecasting Quality from Fertility and Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05425)
*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 仅使用语言类型学特征、词汇生成率等基础特征，无需运行翻译系统即可准确预测GPT-4o在FLORES-200语言对中的翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不运行实际翻译系统的情况下，仅通过语言特征预测翻译质量，以提高多语言评估的效率

Method: 使用词汇生成率比例、词汇计数和语言元数据（语言家族、写作系统、地区）等特征，通过梯度提升模型进行预测

Result: 在FLORES-200语言对中得到了过人的性能（XX→英语R²=0.66，英语→XX R²=0.72），发现语言类型学因素在英语翻译中占主导地位，而词汇生成率在多样化目标语言中更重要

Conclusion: 翻译质量由词汇层面的生成率和更广泛的语言类型学共同形成，为多语言评估和质量估计提供了新的见解

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

### [6] [Direct-Scoring NLG Evaluators Can Use Pairwise Comparisons Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05440)
*Logan Lawrence,Ashton Williamson,Alexander Shelton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种直接评分方法，利用合成摘要来模拟人工排序，以解决现有成对比评估方法无法给出绝对分数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型被广泛用于自动评估自由形式内容，但成对比评估方法虽然相关性好，却无法给出绝对分数，而这对需要阈值处理的应用场景至关重要。

Method: 提出一种直接评分方法，通过使用合成摘要来在测试时模拟成对比机器排序。

Result: 在SummEval (+0.03)、TopicalChat (-0.03)和HANNA (+0.05)等元评估基准上，方法的样本级相关性表现与最先进成对比评估器相当，并公开了合成上下文摘要数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持与成对比评估器相当相关性的同时，提供绝对评分能力，为需要阈值处理的应用场景提供了解决方案。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as
data to facilitate future work.

### [7] [From Staff Messages to Actionable Insights: A Multi-Stage LLM Classification Framework for Healthcare Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05484)
*Hajar Sakai,Yi-En Tseng,Mohammadsadegh Mikaeili,Joshua Bosire,Franziska Jovin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段框架，用于分析医院呼叫中心的员工消息，进行主题识别和多分类分类，最佳模型达到78.4%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院呼叫中心产生大量文本数据，但传统监督学习需要注释数据和谨慎调优，大语言模型提供了更高效的医疗健康分析方法。

Method: 提出多阶段LLM框架，评估包括推理模型、通用模型和轻量模型在内的多种LLM类型，并结合数据安全措施和HIPAA合规要求。

Result: 最佳模型o3达到78.4%积分F1分数和79.2%准确率，gpt-5以次为75.3%积分F1分数和76.2%准确率。处理输出集成到可视化决策支持工具中。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用员工消息数据，识别导航员培训机会，支持改善患者体验和护理质量，为医疗健康环境提供了一种符合安全要求的分析解决方案。

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

### [8] [The Token Tax: Systematic Bias in Multilingual Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05486)
*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,Nihal Karim,Hamza Louzan,Victor Wei,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现词汇分割效率对形态复杂语言有负面影响，分词膨胀率(fertility)能可靠预测模型准确率，推理模型表现更优，分词膨胀导致计算成本呈平方增长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估分词效率对非洲语言处理的影响，分析分词膨胀如何影响模型准确率和计算成本

Method: 在AfriMMLU数据集(9000个多选题，5个科目，16种非洲语言)上评估10个大语言模型，分析分词膨胀率与准确率的关系

Result: 分词膨胀率越高，准确率越低；推理模型在所有语言上都优于非推理模型；分词数量翻倍导致训练成本和时间增加四倍

Conclusion: 需要形态学感知的分词方法、公平定价策略和多语言基准测试，以实现更公平的自然语言处理

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

*Mansi Garg,Lee-Chi Wang,Bhavesh Ghanchi,Sanjana Dumpala,Shreyash Kakde,Yen Chih Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于RAG架构的生物医学文献问答系统，整合多源医学信息，通过语义检索和微调语言模型提供准确、基于证据的医学问答服务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统健康搜索引擎的不足和公众获取生物医学研究的滞后问题，改善准确、基于证据的医学信息获取

Method: 使用MiniLM语义嵌入和FAISS向量搜索的检索管道，结合QLoRA优化的Mistral-7B-v0.3语言模型进行答案生成，整合PubMed文章、问答数据集和医学百科全书

Result: 在乳腺癌文献评估中，BERTScore (F1)显示相比基线模型在事实一致性和语义相关性方面有显著提升

Conclusion: RAG增强的语言模型有潜力弥合复杂生物医学文献与可访问公共卫生知识之间的差距，为多语言适配、隐私保护推理和个性化医疗AI系统的未来发展铺平道路

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出双向推理作为测试AI真正理解的标准，发现现有模型存在认知专业化问题，并开发了对比微调(CFT)方法成功实现双向推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域基础问题：大语言模型是真正理解概念还是仅识别模式。作者认为真正理解应该自然允许可逆性，即能够双向应用转换而无需反向训练。

Method: 提出双向推理测试框架，开发对比微调(CFT)方法，使用三种示例训练：保持语义的正例、不同语义的负例、正向混淆示例，旨在培养深层理解而非表面模式识别。

Result: 实验证明CFT成功实现双向推理，在保持正向任务能力的同时获得强大的反向性能，解决了认知专业化问题。

Conclusion: 双向推理既是评估真正理解的理论框架，也是开发更强大AI系统的实用训练方法，为AI理解能力提供了新的评估标准和改进途径。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

### [11] [Ad hoc conventions generalize to new referents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05566)
*Anya Ji,Claire Augusta Bergey,Ron Eliav,Yoav Artzi,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过双人沟通实验发现，人们在建立新共享命名系统时不是创建任意标签，而是进行真正的概念协调，这种协调能够泛化到未讨论的新对象上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们如何为从未讨论过的事物建立共享命名系统，检验是形成任意标签还是进行概念协调的两种竞争理论。

Method: 使用包含1000多个抽象七巧板图像的KiloGram数据集，让302名参与者成对通过重复沟通协调指称惯例，然后测量他们对未讨论图像描述的协调程度。

Result: 发现强烈的泛化证据：伙伴间的协调程度相对于测试前标签显著增加；泛化随视觉相似性非线性衰减（符合Shepard定律）；在不同可命名性水平上都表现稳健。

Conclusion: 临时约定不是任意标签，而是反映了真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和设计更自适应语言代理具有重要意义。

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

TL;DR: CoPeD方法通过正确性感知任务设置和加权损失函数，提升小语言模型从大语言模型生成的思维链数据中学习推理质量，减少噪声推理的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型通过微调大语言模型生成的思维链数据来复制推理能力，但这些数据可能包含噪声推理，导致模型学习到虚假的相关性，影响推理质量。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD)：1) 正确性感知任务设置，鼓励模型基于正确推理预测答案并修正错误；2) 正确性感知加权损失，根据推理和答案的联合损失动态调整训练样本权重。

Result: 实验表明CoPeD在分布内和分布外基准推理数据集上都有效。

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，有效提升了小语言模型的推理质量，特别是在处理噪声推理数据方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Icon²提出了一种利用LLM表示空间内在调节机制的高效偏好数据集构建方法，通过层间方向向量编码人类偏好并过滤自合成指令，在解码时进行双向内在控制来生成具有明确对齐区分的响应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好数据集构建方法存在分布不匹配和计算开销大的问题：依赖预收集指令导致与目标模型分布不匹配，采样多个随机响应带来巨大计算负担。

Method: 1) 提取层间方向向量编码复杂人类偏好 2) 使用这些向量基于内在一致性过滤自合成指令 3) 在解码时应用双向内在控制来引导token表示，精确生成具有清晰对齐区分的响应对

Result: Llama3-8B和Qwen2-7B在AlpacaEval 2.0上平均胜率提升13.89%，在Arena-Hard上提升13.45%，同时计算成本降低高达48.1%

Conclusion: Icon²通过利用LLM表示空间的内在调节机制，实现了高效且定制化的偏好数据集构建，在提升对齐效果的同时显著降低了计算成本，为LLM对齐提供了一种新的有效范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

Motivation: 传统SEO指标在生成式搜索引擎时代已过时，需要新的方法来理解和优化内容对合成答案的影响。

Method: 构建CC-GSEO-Bench基准测试，提出多维评估框架量化内容影响力，设计多智能体系统实现分析-修订-评估的自动化工作流。

Result: 实证分析揭示了内容影响力的新动态，为内容创作者提供了可操作的优化策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为GSEO建立了原则性基础，为未来研究提供了系统框架和实用工具。

Abstract: The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search
Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized
answers. This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for
Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

*Xugang Lu,Peng Shen,Yu Tsao,Hisashi Kawai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将声学-语言表征对齐问题视为检测问题，提出了一种不平衡最优运输基于的对齐模型，能够灵活处理分布不匹配和结构不对称问题，在CTC基础的ASR系统中提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决声学和语言表征之间的对齐挑战，这种对齐具有内在的结构不对称性（多对一、一对多）和分布不匹配问题，以支持语音识别中的知识转移。

Method: 将对齐问题视为检测问题，提出了一种不平衡最不优运输基于的对齐模型，支持软匹配和部分匹配，确保每个语言标记都有至少一个声学观测基础，同时允许从声学到语言单元的灵活概率映射。

Result: 在基于CTC的ASR系统中进行了实验评估，结果显示该方法能够灵活控制匹配程度，从而提高ASR的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究通过将声学-语言对齐问题重构为检测问题，并提出了一种有效的不平衡最优运输模型，成功地处理了结构不对称和分布不匹配挑战，在ASR任务中显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

TL;DR: SAID是一个新颖的框架，首次统一整合文本和关系结构信息进行预训练，通过QueryAdapt机制在关系标记级别实现细粒度知识迁移，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有意图检测方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了对话系统中关键的查询-查询关系和查询-回答关系等结构信息，导致无法有效捕捉对话的结构特征。

Method: 提出SAID框架，统一整合文本和关系结构信息进行预训练；设计QueryAdapt机制，在关系标记级别生成意图特定的关系标记，实现细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的大量实验结果表明，SAID显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 整合文本和关系结构信息能够有效提升少样本意图检测性能，QueryAdapt机制实现了更细粒度的知识迁移。

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LM-Searcher是一个基于大语言模型的跨领域神经架构搜索框架，使用通用数值编码NCode表示架构，将NAS问题重构为排序任务，无需领域特定调优即可实现高性能架构搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的NAS方法严重依赖提示工程和领域特定调优，限制了其在不同任务中的实用性和可扩展性，需要一种更通用的跨领域神经架构优化方法。

Method: 提出NCode通用数值字符串表示法编码神经架构，将NAS问题重构为排序任务，通过指令调优训练LLM从候选池中选择高性能架构，采用剪枝基子空间采样策略生成训练样本。

Result: 在领域内（如图像分类CNN）和领域外（如分割和生成的LoRA配置）任务中均取得竞争性性能，建立了灵活可泛化的LLM架构搜索新范式。

Conclusion: LM-Searcher为跨领域神经架构优化提供了有效的通用框架，无需大量领域特定适应即可实现高性能搜索，推动了LLM在NAS中的应用发展。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展方法重用范围的新方法，能够处理低相似性或具有隐藏相似性的问题，通过分离问题和解决方案，引导LLM专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法重用通常要求问题高度相似，限制了应用范围。本文旨在扩展方法重用，使其能够处理相似性较低或具有隐藏相似性的问题，提高跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Method: 首先将问题和解决方案分离，而不是直接将问题-解决方案对输入LLM。然后引导LLM将解决方案适配到新的相关问题上，专注于解决方案迁移。该方法还扩展到仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的问题。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了筛选出可重用解决方案的概率，从而改善了跨问题方法重用的效果。

Conclusion: 通过分离问题和解决方案并专注于解决方案迁移，本文的方法成功扩展了方法重用的适用范围，能够处理低相似性和隐藏相似性的问题，显著提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Llama-GENBA-10B是一个10B参数的三语基础模型，针对英语中心偏见问题，在Llama 3.1-8B基础上扩展，支持英语、德语和巴伐利亚语，在巴伐利亚语上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中的英语中心偏见问题，特别针对德语NLP社区需求，同时促进低资源语言巴伐利亚语的发展。

Method: 基于Llama 3.1-8B进行持续预训练，使用164B tokens（82B英语、82B德语、80M巴伐利亚语），创建统一分词器，优化架构和语言比例超参数，建立首个标准化三语评估套件。

Result: 模型在巴伐利亚语上超越Apertus-8B-2509和gemma-2-9b，成为该语言最佳模型；在英语上优于EuroLLM，在德语上与EuroLLM相当。

Conclusion: 提供了整合低资源语言的包容性基础模型蓝图，证明了大规模多语言预训练的效率，为其他低资源语言集成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing
English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled
to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive
foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 当前文本嵌入模型在编码数字信息方面表现差强，无法准确把握数字细节的潜在差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入模型广泛应用于需要理解数字信息的领域（如金融、医疗），但现有评测并没有考察其数字编码能力

Method: 使用金融领域的合成数据，对13个广泛使用的文本嵌入模型进行评估

Result: 模型普遍在准确捕捉数字细节方面表现差强

Conclusion: 需要加强嵌入模型的数字处理能力，以支撑更可靠的NLP系统在数字敏感领域的应用

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对法尔语（Farsi）在主观性NLP任务中的真实资源状况进行了批判性分析，发现虽然数字文本数量在增长，但数据集的可用性、质量和稳定性存在重大问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估法尔语作为"中等资源语言"的真实情况，尤其关注主观性NLP任务中的数据资源挑战

Method: 综述110篇关于法尔语主观性任务的研究文献，分析数据集的公开可用性、人口统计因素包含情况，并在可用数据集上评估预测模型的稳定性

Result: 发现公开数据集严重缺乏，现有数据集缺少关键人口统计信息，预测模型在不同数据集和模型间表现极不稳定

Conclusion: 纯粹的数据量增长不能有效改善语言在NLP领域的前景，数据质量、多样性和稳定性才是关键因素

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

Motivation: 利用量子计算的优势来编码和理解自然语言的复杂性，解决低资源语言数据缺乏问题，探索量子系统在语言处理中的表达能力

Method: 提出QCSE量子上下文敏感嵌入模型，采用量子原生上下文学习，开发五种上下文矩阵计算方法（指数衰减、正弦调制、相位偏移、哈希变换等）来创建基于语言上下文的独特词表示

Conclusion: 量子计算在自然语言处理中具有强大潜力，为QNLP应用于现实世界语言挑战开辟了新途径，特别有助于缓解低资源语言数据不足问题

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

Abstract: This research introduces VeriFact-CoT (Verified Factual Chain-of-Thought), a
novel method designed to address the pervasive issues of hallucination and the
absence of credible citation sources in Large Language Models (LLMs) when
generating complex, fact-sensitive content. By incorporating a multi-stage
mechanism of 'fact verification-reflection-citation integration,' VeriFact-CoT
empowers LLMs to critically self-examine and revise their intermediate
reasoning steps and final answers. This process significantly enhances the
objective accuracy, trustworthiness, and traceability of the generated outputs,
making LLMs more reliable for applications demanding high fidelity such as
scientific research, news reporting, and legal consultation.

Motivation: 为了解决跨语言语音翻译中说话人身份保持的问题，开发一个能够准确保留源说话人特征的多语言TTS模型。

Method: 使用12层仅解码器Transformer，分三阶段训练：文本到音频映射预训练、零样本语音克隆的监督微调、基于WER和说话人相似度指标的DPO对齐。

Result: LatinX模型在DPO训练后持续降低词错误率(WER)并提高客观相似度。人工评估显示比强基线(XTTSv2)具有更强的感知说话人相似性，但揭示了客观与主观度量之间的差距。

Conclusion: LatinX在多语言语音翻译中有效保持说话人身份，未来工作将关注平衡偏好信号和低延迟架构。

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了中医方前生成中的详细信息缺失问题，为中医智能化研究提供了新的技术路径，已开源发布

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同对齐方法对LLM在多轮多方协作中作为合作伙伴效能的影响，提出了摩擦代理干预机制和反事实评估框架，发现摩擦感知方法在促进共识达成和任务正确性方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型成为人类协作伙伴，需要确保其在多轮交互中的行为可预测和可靠。现有对齐技术主要针对单用户场景，缺乏对长期多方交互动态的考虑。

Method: 使用角色扮演方法评估不同训练方式的摩擦代理在协作任务对话中的干预效果，提出了量化摩擦干预如何改变群体协作轨迹和信念对齐的反事实评估框架。

Result: 摩擦感知方法在帮助群体达成共识（共同认可的任务相关命题）和任务结果正确性方面显著优于常见对齐基线方法。

Conclusion: 针对多轮多方协作场景设计的摩擦感知对齐方法比传统单用户对齐技术更有效，能够更好地促进群体协作和决策质量。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

*Yue Gu,Zhihao Du,Ying Shi,Shiliang Zhang,Qian Chen,Jiqing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过三级语义相关性聚合模型，精准识别和集成最相关偏向信息，解决交叉注意力模型在长偏向列表下性能下降问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交叉注意力模型的效果受偏向信息量变化影响，特别是当偏向列表长度大幅增加时，只有少量偏向信息与ASR中间表征最相关

Method: 提出PSC-Joint方法，从粗细到细粒度定义计算三级语义相关性（列表级、短语级、标记级），聚合模型获取其交集来突出最相关偏向信息，并使用分组竞争筛选机制降低计算成本

Result: 在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上，相比基线模型实现了平均相对F1分数提升21.34%和28.46%的改进

Conclusion: PSC-Joint方法通过精准识别和集成最相关偏向信息，有效缓解了偏向信息量变化对交叉注意力模型的影响，在不同长度偏向列表下都取得了显著性能提升

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

TL;DR: 通过算法与架构协同设计，解决了早期退出机制在批处理推理中导致系统瓶颈的问题，在保持性能的同时提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算成本高，适应性计算方法如早期退出虽能节省计算，但在批处理推理中反而导致系统瓶颈和吞吐量下降

Method: 1）提出高效并行解码机制减少早期退出开销 2）采用深度参数共享架构缩减模型并缓解同步问题 3）预训练轻量路由器动态分配最优递归深度

Result: 建立了效率与性能之间的新帕累托前沿，在单个模型内同时优化了适应性计算和参数效率

Conclusion: 通过算法-架构协同设计成功解决了动态计算与系统效率的本质矛盾，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

TL;DR: KatotohananQA是TruthfulQA基准的菲律宾语翻译版本，用于评估LLMs在低资源语言中的真实性表现。研究发现英语和菲律宾语之间存在显著性能差距，新OpenAI模型展现多语言鲁棒性，但不同问题类型存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs真实性基准主要针对英语，缺乏对低资源语言的评估，限制了LLMs在多语言环境中的可靠应用。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语(KatotohananQA)，使用二元选择框架评估7个免费专有模型，比较英语和菲律宾语版本的表现差异。

Result: 发现英语和菲律宾语真实性存在显著性能差距；新版OpenAI模型(GPT-5和GPT-5 mini)展现较强的多语言鲁棒性；不同问题类型、类别和主题的跨语言迁移鲁棒性存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的多语言评估来确保LLMs使用的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在多语言迁移中表现较弱，凸显了多语言基准的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了多模态对话历史中词级别的细粒度语义和韵律交互建模，导致生成的语音韵律不够自然

Method: 构建语义交互图和韵律交互图两个多模态细粒度对话交互图，编码词级别语义、韵律及其对后续话语的影响

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表现力方面优于所有基线模型

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的多模态上下文交互建模，能够有效提升对话语音合成的韵律自然度

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at
https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数正则化方法如O-LoRA和N-LoRA通过强制低秩子空间正交性来渗缓任务干扰，但忽视了传统加性微调会突破LLM参数的内在几何结构，限制了性能。

Method: 提出OLieRA方法，将李群理论引入LLM微调：利用乘性更新保持参数几何结构，同时在任务子空间上应用正交约束。

Result: 实验表明OLieRA在标准连续学习测试集上达到了最佳结果，并在大量任务设置中保持顶级性能。

Conclusion: 保持LLM参数空间的几何结构对于缓解多任务序列学习中的灾难性遗忘至关重要，OLieRA通过结合李群理论和乘性更新有效地解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要评估大型语言模型在政治敏感语境中的表现，特别是识别和量化模型可能存在的偏见，以促进NLP在政治领域的公平性和问责制研究。

Method: 构建EuroParlVote数据集，链接欧洲议会辩论演讲与投票结果，包含丰富的议员人口统计信息。在两个任务上评估最先进的LLM：性别分类和投票预测。

Result: 发现LLM存在一致的偏见模式：经常将女性议员误分类为男性；在模拟女性发言人投票时准确率降低；政治上偏向中间派团体，在极左和极右团体上表现较差。GPT-4o等专有模型在鲁棒性和公平性方面优于开源模型。

Conclusion: LLM在政治敏感语境中存在系统性偏见，需要进一步研究来提高公平性和问责制。EuroParlVote数据集、代码和演示的发布将支持未来在政治语境中NLP公平性研究。

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Motivation: 当前文本嵌入器的发展依赖于大量合成数据训练，但公开的合成数据集缺乏，阻碍了对合成数据在模型普遍化中作用的研究。研究者想要解决这一问题并深入分析合成数据的真正效果。

Method: 首先重现并公开释放Wang等人提出的Mistral-E5合成数据集，然后系统性地分析合成数据在哪些方面改善了模型的普遍化能力。

Result: 合成数据虽然质量高且能够一致地提升性能，但其帮助效果很稀疏且仅限于个别数据集。研究还发现了不同任务之间的性能拼搏：对某个任务有益的数据可能会降低其他任务的表现。

Conclusion: 当前的合成数据方法在构建通用文本嵌入器方面存在明显局限性。这些发现挑战了"训练合成数据能够带来更健壮的嵌入模型"的观念，指出需要更深入的研究来理解合成数据的真正作用机制。

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

Motivation: 现有的GCG越狱攻击方法使用固定长度的后缀，但其中可能存在token冗余问题未被探索，需要更高效和可解释的攻击方法。

Method: 提出Mask-GCG方法，使用可学习的token掩码来识别后缀中有影响力的token位置，增加高影响力位置的更新概率，修剪低影响力位置的token。

Result: 实验表明后缀中大部分token对攻击成功有显著贡献，修剪少数低影响力token不会影响损失值或攻击成功率，揭示了LLM提示中的token冗余。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了梯度空间大小和计算开销，缩短了成功攻击时间，为从越狱攻击角度开发高效可解释的LLM提供了见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: PL-CA提出参数化RAG框架，将法律知识编码为参数向量并集成到LLM中，缓解上下文压力，同时构建专家标注的多任务法律数据集验证效果。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限的上下文窗口，带来额外计算开销并干扰模型注意力，影响下游任务性能。现有基准缺乏专家标注且只关注单一任务，无法反映真实法律场景中多任务混合的需求。

Method: 提出PL-CA方法，采用参数化RAG框架对语料知识进行数据增强，将法律知识编码为参数向量，通过LoRA技术将这些参数化知识集成到LLM的前馈网络中。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少过长上下文开销的同时，在下游任务上保持与传统RAG相当的竞争性能。

Conclusion: PL-CA通过参数化知识集成有效缓解了模型上下文压力，为法律领域的知识增强提供了新的解决方案，同时构建的高质量多任务数据集为后续研究提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

Result: 英语表现最佳，资源较少语言（如瓦伦西亚语）表现显著较差；上下文支持对低资源语言有一定帮助但效果不一。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在多语言常识生成方面存在明显局限性，特别是在低资源语言上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual
commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/gplsi/MULTICOM.

TL;DR: WebExplorer是一个创新的网络代理框架，通过模型驱动的探索和迭代查询演化生成高质量训练数据，开发出支持128K上下文和100轮工具调用的8B参数模型，在多项信息搜索基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源网络代理在复杂任务上的信息搜索能力有限或缺乏透明实现，主要挑战在于缺乏具有挑战性的信息搜索数据。

Method: 采用模型驱动的探索和迭代式长到短查询演化方法生成高质量数据集，通过监督微调后接强化学习训练WebExplorer-8B模型。

Result: WebExplorer-8B在BrowseComp-en/zh上超越WebSailor-72B，在WebWalkerQA和FRAMES上达到100B参数以下模型最佳性能，支持平均16轮搜索，并在HLE基准上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为长视野网络代理的开发提供了实用路径，证明了通过高质量数据生成和强化学习训练可以显著提升小型模型在复杂网络导航任务中的性能。

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

*Andrei Baroian,Kasper Notebomer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种新的层间缩放变体（Framed、Reverse、Crown），通过在预训练阶段重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头，在固定参数预算下实现了比各向同性基线更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer语言模型使用统一的层大小，忽略了不同深度可能扮演的多样化功能角色及其计算容量需求。

Method: 基于层间缩放（LWS）和剪枝文献，引入三种新的LWS变体，通过两点或三点线性插值在预训练阶段重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头。

Result: 在180M参数固定预算和5B tokens训练下，所有模型都收敛到相似的损失，相比等成本各向同性基线获得更好性能，且训练吞吐量没有显著下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了预训练层间架构设计空间的初步探索，但未来工作需要扩展到更多tokens和参数规模来充分评估其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAMDAS是一种利用预训练大语言模型作为隐式分类器进行领域特定数据选择的新方法，仅需少量参考数据就能高效筛选高质量训练数据，在性能和计算效率方面都优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域适配中高质量人工标注数据稀缺，而大量未检查数据直接用于微调会引入噪声导致性能下降。现有数据选择方法难以同时达到准确性和效率的要求

Method: 将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，利用预训练LLM本身作为隐式分类器，无需显式特征工程和计算密集型优化过程，通过小规模参考数据集识别属于目标域的候选数据

Result: 实验表明LAMDAS不仅能用少量数据超越全数据训练性能，还在各种场景下优于9个SOTA基线方法，在性能提升和计算效率之间达到了最佳平衡

Conclusion: LAMDAS提供了一种高效准确的领域数据选择方案，解决了LLM领域适配中的数据质量瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在知识图谱链接预测中结构信息利用不足导致的稀疏性和语义模糊问题，特别是在不完整和零样本设置下。

Method: 提出SLiNT框架：1) SGNE检索伪邻居丰富稀疏实体；2) DHCL通过硬正负样本对比学习解决实体级模糊；3) GDDI进行token级结构感知干预同时保持LLM核心参数。

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15k-237数据集上，SLiNT相比基于嵌入和生成的基线方法取得了优越或竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: 结构感知表示学习对于可扩展知识图谱补全是有效的，SLiNT框架成功整合了结构信息和语义上下文。

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE是一个无需参数调优的解码框架，通过头自适应门控和值校准技术解决LLM幻觉问题，在多个QA基准测试中有效减少幻觉并优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在检索增强生成长上下文时经常产生幻觉，即使相关证据存在。这源于两个问题：头重要性被视为输入无关的，原始注意力权重不能很好地反映每个token的真实贡献

Method: 提出HAVE框架，包含头自适应门控（实例级软重加权注意力头）和值校准（通过值向量大小增强注意力以近似回写贡献），通过轻量级不确定性缩放策略将token级证据与语言模型分布融合

Result: 在多个QA基准测试和LLM家族上的实验表明，HAVE持续减少幻觉并优于包括DAGCD在内的强基线方法，且开销适中

Conclusion: HAVE框架透明、可复现，可轻松集成到现成的LLM中，在现实场景中推进可信生成

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,
XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups
(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights
and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

Motivation: 互文性是文学研究中的核心概念，但传统方法难以进行大规模量化分析。本文旨在开发一种可扩展的量化模型，以实现对文本间互文关系的系统性分析。

Method: 使用文本嵌入技术，对两个文本的n-gram进行成对比较，然后平均计算结果作为整体互文性得分。

Result: 在4个已知互文性程度的文本上验证有效，并在267个多样化文本上进行可扩展性测试，证明方法既有效又高效。网络分析还揭示了中心性和社区结构。

Conclusion: 该方法成功捕捉和量化了互文关系，为文学研究提供了可扩展的量化分析工具，网络分析进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the
intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,
demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis
further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's
success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统粗排序优化方法难以平衡领域特定知识学习和查询增强，导致检索性能不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）使用混合损失（MoL）进行持续预训练，平衡领域知识和通用语言能力；2）使用组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行强化学习，优化查询和段落生成以最大化文档召回率。创新性地提出多查询单段落后期融合（MSLF）策略降低计算开销。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，MoLER实现了最先进的性能，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MoLER填补了RAG系统中的知识空白，能够在专业领域实现鲁棒且可扩展的检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

Motivation: 二语习得中学习者的参与度和动机至关重要，但现有研究主要关注教育文本的趣味性，对对话中驱动参与度的语言特征了解甚少

Method: 基于教师-学生聊天室语料库(TSCC)，采用基于比较的评分方法，由100多名二语学习者进行序列级标注，研究兴趣在扩展对话中的演变

Result: 在趣味性评分上微调的7B/8B参数LLM优于GPT-4o等大型专有模型，证明了专门数据集在教育场景中建模参与度的潜力

Conclusion: 分析了具体性、可理解性(可读性)和接受度等语言和认知因素对教育对话参与度的影响，为教育对话系统开发提供了重要见解

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Result: 直接主观性识别显著提高了标记主观论点的模型性能。对比损失与二元交叉熵损失的组合不能提升性能，但减少了每个标签主观性的依赖性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以帮助识别个体可能有不同解释的论点，促进更细致的标注过程。

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ProCon方法，通过投影约束损失来减少指令微调过程中拒绝方向的偏移，从而在保持任务性能的同时提升大语言模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令微调(IFT)虽然能提升大语言模型的能力，但会明显降低模型的安全性，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力。研究发现这与隐藏状态中拒绝方向(r-direction)的偏移有关。

Method: 提出ProCon方法，在损失函数中添加投影约束项，用于规范化训练样本隐藏状态在r方向上的投影大小。进一步使用热身策略，在训练初期应用强约束，并扩展数据分布来强化约束信号。

Result: 在多种数据集、场景和大语言模型上的实验结果显示，ProCon能够显著减少IFT带来的安全风险，同时保持任务性能的提升。与强基线方法相比，ProCon一贵表现出更优异的整体性能。

Conclusion: ProCon方法能够有效稳定训练过程中的拒绝方向，为未来的大语言模型安全研究奠定了坚实基础。这种基于可解释性的内部机制探索方法开启了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM是一个通过持续预训练框架，让通用大语言模型获得强大上下文机器学习能力，同时保持通用知识推理能力的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备广泛的世界知识和通用推理能力，但在标准机器学习任务中难以通过纯上下文学习从大量示例中有效学习。

Method: 使用结构因果模型合成数百万个ML任务进行持续预训练，采用随机森林教师进行知识蒸馏，使用token高效的提示序列化方法，支持最多1024个示例的上下文窗口。

Result: 在金融、物理、生物和医疗等领域的分布外表格分类任务上平均比GPT-5-mini等强基线模型提升约15%，准确率随上下文示例数量从8增加到1024而单调提升，在MMLU上达到75.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM成功实现了在保持通用对话能力的同时，显著提升大语言模型的上下文机器学习能力，展现出强大的多示例扩展规律。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

*Yanrui Du,Fenglei Fan,Sendong Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Ting Liu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoGU_v2框架通过动态路由机制平衡LLM的安全性和可用性，在多种LLM类型上实现稳定改进，无需在安全性和实用性之间进行权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在面对恶意指令时过度保守拒绝响应而损害实用性的问题，推进安全性和可用性的帕累托前沿。

Method: 提出MoGU_v2框架，在编码高分类性安全特征的层中嵌入路由器，通过双向适配机制实现安全优化和可用性优化变体的动态权重分配。

Result: 在主流LLM、设备端LLM和推理LLM等多种模型系列上表现出强适应性和稳定改进，能轻松恢复指令微调带来的安全风险。

Conclusion: MoGU_v2是一个强大且多功能的解决方案，能有效缓解现实应用中的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量逻辑声数据短缺问题，提供可扩展的符号训练数据来提升大语言模型的数学推理能力

Method: 利用E-prover的饱和证明技术在TPTP公理库上生成保证正确的定理，筛选"6709趣"定理，构建含含否定验证、前提选择和证明重构的三种难度控制任务

Result: 零样本实验显示前沿模型在需要深层结构化推理的任务上表现出明显的性能衰退

Conclusion: 该框架既提供了评估模型逻辑推理空白的诊断工具，也为解决这些问题提供了可扩展的符号训练数据来源

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

### [59] [A Comparative Benchmark of Large Language Models for Labelling Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06813)
*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Alasdair McDonald,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估大语言模型在风力涡轮机维护日志分类任务上的基准测试框架，系统评估了多种先进模型在可靠性、效率和校准方面的表现，发现模型在客观组件识别上表现更好，建议采用人机协作系统作为最佳应用方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力发电运维中非结构化的维护日志文本难以进行自动化分析，需要开发可靠的基准测试框架来评估大语言模型在此工业场景中的分类性能。

Method: 开发了一个开源的可复现基准测试框架，系统评估了多种先进的大语言模型（包括专有和开源模型），分析其在可靠性、操作效率和模型校准方面的权衡。

Result: 建立了清晰的性能层次结构，确定了与基准标准高度对齐且具有可信校准置信度得分的顶级模型。分类性能高度依赖于任务的语义模糊性，所有模型在客观组件识别上的共识度高于解释性维护动作。

Conclusion: 由于没有模型达到完美准确度且校准性能差异很大，最有效和负责任的应用是采用人机协作系统，让大语言模型作为强大助手来加速和标准化数据标注，从而提高运维数据质量和下游可靠性分析。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

*Eugene Kwek,Wenpeng Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPACT是一种联合剪枝方法，同时剪枝稀有词汇和FFN中间通道，保持标准Transformer架构，实现高效部署和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使LLM在内存、延迟和服务成本方面更高效，适用于边缘部署、交互应用和大规模可持续推理。现有剪枝方法存在局限性：宽度剪枝破坏标准架构或需要定制推理代码，深度剪枝移除整个层导致精度骤降

Method: 联合剪枝：(1)剪枝稀有词汇以缩小嵌入/解嵌入层，(2)基于常见词加权的激活值剪枝FFN中间通道，使重要性对齐剪枝后的词分布

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列(0.5B-70B)上实验显示，在相似或更高剪枝率下达到最先进的下游任务性能，大幅减少参数、GPU内存和端到端延迟

Conclusion: COMPACT结合了深度和宽度剪枝的优点：部署友好性、规模适应性、免训练操作、竞争性剪枝时间，以及强大的内存节省和吞吐量增益

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言任务上表现出色，但确保其可信度仍是关键挑战，需要与文化背景相一致的评估标准来开发负责任的AI系统

Method: 开发了EPT评估指标，包含真实性、安全性、公平性、鲁棒性、隐私和伦理对齐六个维度，使用标注数据集对ChatGPT、Claude等多个主流模型进行了自动化和人工评估

Result: 结果显示在安全性维度存在显著缺陷，为模型与波斯伦理文化价值观的对齐提供了宝贵见解，揭示了关键差距和发展机会

Conclusion: 需要重点关注模型行为的安全性方面，EPT基准为推进可信赖和文化负责任的AI提供了重要工具和数据集

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

TL;DR: 提出AggLM方法，通过强化学习训练聚合器模型来综合多个候选解决方案，生成更准确的最终答案，优于传统的多数投票和奖励模型排序方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时计算扩展主要依赖简单的多数投票或奖励模型排序来聚合解决方案，但这些方法收益有限，需要更智能的聚合策略。

Method: 使用强化学习训练聚合器模型，通过学习平衡简单和困难训练样本，能够恢复少数但正确的答案以及容易的多数正确答案。

Result: AggLM在多个基准测试中优于基于规则和奖励模型的基线方法，能够有效泛化到不同模型的解决方案，且比多数投票方法需要更少的token。

Conclusion: 将聚合作为显式推理技能学习是有效的，通过精心设计的训练策略，聚合器模型能够显著提升大语言模型在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Motivation: 参与CheckThat! Task 2英文任务，旨在开发有效方法从社交媒体内容中识别和提取值得进行事实核查的声明。

Method: 使用了多种提示学习和上下文学习方法，包括少样本提示技术，并对不同大型语言模型（LLM）家族进行微调，特别关注FLAN-T5模型的微调。

Result: 微调FLAN-T5模型获得了最佳的METEOR分数，但研究发现其他方法虽然METEOR分数较低，有时却能提取出更高质量的声明。

Conclusion: 虽然自动评估指标（如METEOR）在模型比较中有用，但可能无法完全捕捉声明提取的质量，需要结合人工评估来获得更全面的性能理解。

Abstract: We participate in CheckThat! Task 2 English and explore various methods of
prompting and in-context learning, including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning
with different LLM families, with the goal of extracting check-worthy claims
from social media passages. Our best METEOR score is achieved by fine-tuning a
FLAN-T5 model. However, we observe that higher-quality claims can sometimes be
extracted using other methods, even when their METEOR scores are lower.

TL;DR: mmBERT是一个基于3T多语言文本训练的编码器模型，在1800多种语言上表现出色，特别是在低资源语言分类和检索任务上超越前代模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对编码器模型的最新研究，特别是多语言模型方面存在空白，需要开发能够处理多种语言的高效编码器模型

Method: 使用3T多语言文本训练，引入逆掩码比率调度和逆温度采样比率，在衰减阶段加入1700多种低资源语言数据

Result: 在分类和检索任务上显著优于前代模型，在低资源语言上表现尤其突出，性能可与OpenAI o3和Google Gemini 2.5 Pro相媲美

Conclusion: 通过创新的训练策略和数据调度方法，mmBERT证明了编码器模型在多语言处理方面的巨大潜力，特别是在低资源语言上的优异表现

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

*Aivin V. Solatorio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN) 是一种展示层协议，通过机械验证强制保证大语言模型生成数字的准确性，将验证放在渲染器而非模型中，确保只有经过验证的数字才被标记为可信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为随机系统可能生成与可用数据偏差的数字（数值幻觉），现有安全措施如检索增强生成、引用和不确定性估计虽然提高了透明度，但无法保证保真度，仍可能显示伪造或错误引用的数值。

Method: PCN 将数字跨度作为与结构化声明绑定的声明绑定令牌发出，验证器根据声明的策略（如精确相等、舍入、别名或带限定符的容差）检查每个令牌。验证放在渲染器而非模型中，只有经过声明检查的数字才被标记为已验证，其他默认未验证。

Result: PCN 被形式化并证明了其可靠性、诚实令牌下的完整性、故障关闭行为和策略细化下的单调性。PCN 轻量级且模型无关，可无缝集成到现有应用中，并可扩展加密承诺。

Conclusion: 通过在显示前强制验证，PCN 为数值敏感环境建立了一个简单契约：信任只能通过证明获得，而缺少标记则传达不确定性，有效防止欺骗并保证故障关闭行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双层优化的新方法，通过将SFT目标条件化于最优RL策略，实现SFT和RL训练的更好协作，在五个推理基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法（先SFT后RL）限制了SFT和RL之间的交互，影响了整体效果。RL虽然能激励大语言模型的推理能力，但试错性质导致效率低下。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：下层执行RL更新同时接收SFT监督，上层显式最大化协作增益（联合训练相比单独RL的性能优势）。SFT目标条件化于最优RL策略，实现元学习指导RL优化过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，该方法 consistently outperforms baselines，在效果和效率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 双层优化方法能够促进SFT和RL训练范式之间的更好协作，相比传统两阶段方法具有显著优势，为学习推理模型提供了更有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳，需要一种能够整合偏好推理轨迹的后训练框架来提升性能，同时保持架构灵活性。

Method: 提出TraceRL框架，使用扩散价值模型增强训练稳定性，支持不同架构的扩散语言模型后训练，并通过课程学习实现长链推理能力。

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct在数学推理任务上超越7B规模的AR模型，TraDo-8B-Instruct相比Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct和Llama3.1-8B-Instruct分别提升6.1%和51.3%的准确率，首个长链推理DLM在MATH500上相对提升18.1%。

Conclusion: TraceRL框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理性能，支持灵活的架构扩展，并提供了开源实现促进可复现研究和实际应用。

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

Motivation: 随着语言模型作为会话助所的广泛使用，需要理解其语用理解能力，即如何根据交际目标和语境规范进行理性推理。

Method: 使用Wavelength通信游戏构建评估框架，研究不同规模的语言模型在语言理解和生成任务上的表现，测试直接提示、思维链(CoT)提示以及量化语用理论(RSA)方法的效果。

Result: 现有最先进的大型语言模型在语言理解任务上达到了类似于人类的准确率，与人类判断呈现高相关性，而较小模型表现较差。在语言生成任务上，CoT提示比直接提示效果更好，而RSA方法能够显著提升两种提示方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究帮助识别语言模型在语用理解能力方面的优势与局限性，并证明了RSA方法在改善模型性能方面的潜力，为未来理解概念表征、语言理解和社会推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

TL;DR: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类别间关系，改进传统标签平滑方法，缓解过拟合和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑方法虽然能提高泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同重要性，破坏了类别间的关系结构。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++策略，保持目标类别的固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，考虑类别间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类别间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过更好地建模类别间关系，在保持泛化能力的同时改进了传统标签平滑方法的局限性。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 解决目标检测中大规模标注数据集获取困难的问题，传统主动学习方法缺乏透明度且可能忽略重要样本，需要结合人类专家的直觉和智能。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，集成t-SNE特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态可视化，支持用户探索数据、解释模型状态并实施多样化的样本选择策略。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

Result: 在CIFAR-10上ResNet-50教师和ResNet-18学生实验中，方法超越固定权重KD基线，准确度更高且收敛更稳定。

Conclusion: 动态调整硬软监督权重的自适应知识蓄粉框架能够有效提升学生模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

Conclusion: 研究提供了初步证据表明FRC基于剪枝是一种有效的神经网络压缩方法，为计算效率更高的网络优化技术提供了新的可能性，特别是在需要平衡性能和计算成本的场景中。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Motivation: 现实部署中目标识别模型面临域偏移导致准确率严重下降的问题，包括图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡和类别混淆等挑战

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生带4线索标注的图像，对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督微调，推理时执行两阶段重新思考机制

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM始终超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自我批判循环的结合是实现可靠和可迁移视觉理解的有前途途径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了大规模中文手写数据库，开发了OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具箱，通过多元回归分析发现词汇形、音、义等语言因素在字符、部首和笔画层面对手写准备和执行的层级衰减影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写过程中语言组件（语音、语义、形态）在不同层次的调控机制问题，以及缺乏细粒度手写数据采集和批量处理工具的问题。

Method: 构建大规模中文手写数据库（42名受试者每人写作1200个字符），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具箱，采用多元回归分析手写准备和执行参数（延迟、持续时间、笔压等）。

Result: 发现形态预测因子在字符、部首和笔画层面都影响手写准备和执行；语音因素在所有三个层次都影响执行。词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征：字符层最明显，部首层次之，笔画层最弱。

Conclusion: 手写准备和执行在部首和笔画层面与语言组件密切相关，该数据库和工具箱为语言心理学和语言神经学研究提供了价值贵资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要。

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。输入为从视频序列提取的实时骨骼特征。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision

binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Conclusion: DVRF成功连接了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的无反演文本到图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小波的频率感知变分自编码器(FA-VAE)框架，通过显式解耦低频和高频分量的优化，解决了现有潜在标记器在纹理区域重建时高频细节丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在生成模型的两阶段训练过程中，图像压缩为潜在嵌入的质量对生成效果至关重要。传统目标函数固有地优先重建低频信息，导致高频保真度不足，重建图像在纹理区域缺乏真实感，出现过度平滑和视觉伪影。

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现真实图像表示具有重要意义，在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等应用中具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

TL;DR: 研究分析了YOLOv8和YOLOv10在资源受限环境中的层冻结策，发现最佳冻结方案依赖于数据特性，能节省28%的GPU内存消耗，某些情况下甚至超越全量微调的检测精度。

Motivation: 将YOLO架构部署到资源受限环境（如无人机）需要高效转移学习，但层冻结策对当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10的具体影响仍未明确。

Method: 系统研究多种冻结配置，集成梯度行为分析（L2范数）和可视化解释（Grad-CAM）来揭示不同冻结策略下的训练动态。

Result: 发现没有通用最佳冻结策略，而是依赖于数据特性：冻结背骨网络有效保保通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。节省较多GPU内存且某些情况下检测精度更高。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了实证发现和实用指南，为资源受限场景下的对象检测转移学习提供了平衡的、基于证据的方法。

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Motivation: 传统四元数神经网络试图完全在四元数域中操作，计算复杂且效率低。QUAN旨在通过实数运算近似四元数卷积，在保持旋转等变性的同时提高计算效率。

Method: 使用Hamilton乘积分解通过实数运算近似四元数卷积，引入独立四元数批量归一化(IQBN)提高训练稳定性，并将四元数操作扩展到空间注意力机制。

Result: 在图像分类任务(CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet)中，QUAN以更少的参数和更快的收敛速度获得更高准确率；在目标检测任务(COCO, DOTA)中，相比标准CNN表现出更好的参数效率和旋转处理能力。

Conclusion: QUAN框架在保持几何特性的同时实现了高效计算，特别适合资源受限的机器人系统和其他需要旋转感知的应用领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Conclusion: 该对比学习框架通过创新的数据增强和双代理任务设计，成功学习了适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示，在骨架序列的动作分割任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: 所提出的RED网络通过稳健性训练和模态特定解耦表征，有效解决了事件流不完整性导致的问题，在动态去模糊任务中表现出艶为。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated

input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph：基于语言引导的时空图建模的视频摘要方法，通过将对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图节点，结合语言查询实现语义关系建模，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的关系。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语义信息

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边连接表示语义关系。引入语言查询到图节点表示中以避免仅基于视觉相似性配置边，采用递归策略优化初始图并正确分类关键帧

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦视频摘要基准测试中，无论是监督还是无监督方式，VideoGraph都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题，通过语义关系建模和递归优化策略，能够有效提升视频摘要的性能表现

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)方法，通过自监督学习将预训练的语义知识转移到密集特征空间，在密集视觉任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督表示学习方法主要关注全局表示，但缺乏对密集预测任务所需的局部语义和空间精度的捕捉

Method: 提出PaKA对齐目标，通过匹配教师和学生模型之间密集补丁的统计依赖关系来对齐特征分布，并研究专门针对密集表示学习的数据增强策略

Result: 在多种密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了密集表示学习中的局部语义捕捉问题，证明了通过自监督学习将语义知识转移到密集特征空间的有效性

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的视觉-语言-动作模型剪枝方法，通过结合局部和全局信息进行两级剪枝，在保持成功率的同时实现1.46-1.57倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限

Method: 提出静态剪枝（动作级别，利用全局历史和局部上下文减少视觉token）和动态剪枝（层级级别，基于层级重要性剪枝token），并采用轻量级动作感知控制器根据动作粒度调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，相比OpenVLA-OFT，在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局信息的智能剪枝策略能够有效提升VLA模型的推理速度，同时保持模型性能，为计算密集型模型的加速提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa是一种新的概念擦除方法，专门针对窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除，通过子空间映射技术实现鲁棒性和有效性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于窄概念（版权内容、名人等）的擦除存在挑战，需要解决版权和法律问题。

Method: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法：首先推导表示目标概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化距离的参考子空间来实现概念中和。

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，在完整性上与专注于完整性的方法相当。

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签的情况下的分析具有挑战性。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法，构建反映植被特性的嵌入空间来表示树木特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用植被特性相关的嵌入空间构建的树木表示在下游机器学习任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效提取高光谱图像中的植被特性信息，为精准农业中的树木分析提供了更好的特征表示方法。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了YOLO模型在孜加拉地区特有车辆检测中的性能，发现YOLOv11x表现最佳，但中等模型在性能和速度之间取得了更好平衡。研究还发现少见车辆类别检测准确度低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为基于非孜加拉数据集训练的车辆检测系统在孜加拉独特道路环境中无法准确识别本地车辆类型，影响了自动驾驶技术在发展中地区的应用。

Method: 使用6种YOLO模型变体在包含29种孜加拉特有车辆类别的自定义数据集上进行评估，数据集包含高清图片并使用LabelImg进行手动标注。

Result: YOLOv11x表现最好（mAP@0.5为63.7%），但速度慢（45.8毫秒/图片）。中等模型在性能和速度之间取得优化平衡，YOLOv8m和YOLOv11m的mAP@0.5分别达到62.5%和61.8%，速度仅14-15毫秒。少见车辆类别（如建筑车辆和Desi Nosimons）检测准确度极低，视觉相似车辆容易歧误分类。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发适合孜加拉交通条件的强壁物体检测系统奠定了基础，解决了通用模型在发展中地区无法有效工作的关键问题。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入，通过改进ID特征集成模块和可编辑性注入机制，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多层级语义编辑和身份一致性保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多层级语义编辑。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑，满足长提示词和高质量图像生成需求，在IBench评估中取得优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的技术方法在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的复杂语义编辑。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的场景图预测方法(OOTSM)，通过两阶段LLM处理实现对象状态预测和关系生成，在短期和长期预测上均取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景中的对象、概念和关系

Method: 将场景图预测任务解耦为两步：先用场景图捕获模型将视频转换为场景图序列，再用纯文本模型预测未来帧的场景图。提出面向对象的两阶段方法(OOTSM)，LLM先预测对象出现/消失，再生成详细的人-物关系

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 语言场景图预测(LSGA)作为独立任务具有研究价值，提出的OOTSM方法有效整合了常识知识，显著提升了场景图预测的长期鲁棒性

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Motivation: 受高能粒子物理中堆积器减少策略的启发，想要将物理导向的归纳偏见（如守恒性、局部性、隔离性）应用于图像去噪任务，以提高模型在强污染条件下的稳健性。

Method: 提出了一个受堆积器启发的去噪器层次结构：包括带守恒约束的清漏CNN、其高斯噪声变体以及WIPUNet（结合这些理念的UNet背锁网络）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上的实验显示，PU风格CNN与标准基线模型相竞争，而WIPUNet在高噪声水平下显示出越来越明显的优势，说明物理启发的偏见提供了稳健性。

Conclusion: 物理启发的归纳偏见可以作为模块化组件嵌入神经网络架构，在高噪声条件下提供优秀的稳健性，而无需依赖复杂的最先进模型。

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现出色，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理视觉特征和文本语义表示；2) Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器注意力到相关图像区域

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等多个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过创新的上下文记忆和注意力机制，显著提升了多轮视觉-文本推理的连贯性和准确性

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割领域存在严重的可复现性危机，其中评价指标的实现不可靠是主要原因之一。当前开源工具在计算Hausdorff距离等指标时存在显著偏差，影响研究结果的可靠性。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用网面基础的方法替代传统的格点基础方法来计算距离基础的评价指标，通过理论分析和实验验证其优势。

Result: 经验证显示MeshMetrics比现有工具具有更高的精度和准确性，对离散化效应（如距离量化）的影响显著降低，能够减少距离计算的误差。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为一个开源Python包提供了更可靠的图像分割评价方案，有助于提高研究可复现性和评价指标计算的准确性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在视频动作识别中难以处理深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分，而大语言模型具有强大的语义理解能力，因此探索将视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频转换为离散的语义动作标记，结合自然语言指令，使用LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub 94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set 90.0%），并显著提升模型可解释性。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR成功将视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅取得了优异的性能表现，还通过生成自然语言解释增强了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制改进雷达/声纳到LiDAR的转换，提升SLAM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致性问题，提高下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换任务中表现出更好的时间和空间一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的多模态融合特性，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景建模和外参补偿有效解决了多相机融合的挑战，为高精度状态估计提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了首个基于理论基础的距离适配性超分辨框架，通过模型化空间变化的退化过程和深度条件卷积核，在实际场景中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨方法假设空间不变的退化模型，但真实成像系统存在复杂的距离依赖效应，如大气散射、景深变化等，需要空间适配性重建策略。

Method: 提出变分框架将超分辨模型为空间变化逆问题，通过伪微分运算符描述距离依赖的频谱特性。等式深度学习网络实现离散梯度流动力学，使用深度条件卷积核和学习的距离适配正则化项。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最佳性能，在KITTI户外场景上2倍和4倍缩放时分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM值，比现有方法分别提升0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这个工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离适配性超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中实现了显著性能提升，同时在传统标准测试中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决日常场景中两人交互行为的准确捕捉问题，现有工作要么只考虑单人，要么只关注对话手势，假设身体朝向和位置基本不变，而实际交互是目标驱动、动态且语义一致的长期过程。

Method: 采集了241个运动序列的InterAct多模态数据集，包含音频、身体运动和面部表情；提出了基于扩散的分层回归方法，通过新颖的微调机制提高嘴唇准确性。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集填补了长期动态交互行为数据的空白，提出的扩散方法为两人交互行为生成提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Method: 1）将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2）时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3）分层识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS框架通过分层推理和LLM驱动的方法，有效解决了视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐挑战，无需训练即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Conclusion: 该方法可作为现有形状模型重建流程的简单预处理步骤，具有即插即用的广泛应用前景，显著提升了部分形状重建的性能。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，通过3DPillars和稀疏场景特征模块有效充分利用了场景上下文信息，成功缩小了PointPillars与狭阶方法的性能差距，为高效高性能3D检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，显著提升了3D目标检测性能

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中存在的固有模糊性。这在医学成像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性或专家间差异可能导致多个合理分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调节提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效处理医学图像分割中的不确定性，为不确定性感知输出提供了高效采样机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

TL;DR: 在心血管组织病理学图像分割任务中，即使采用最先进的深度学习模型和贝叶斯超参数优化，模型性能对数据划分高度敏感，性能差异主要来自统计噪声而非算法优势，这揭示了低数据临床环境中标准基准测试的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

TL;DR: BTCChat是一个多时相MLLM模型，通过Change Extraction模块和Prompt Augmentation机制，在双时相卫星图像变化分析中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过直接拼接处理图像对，无法充分建模时间相关性和空间语义变化，限制了变化理解中的视觉-语义对齐效果。

Method: 提出BTCChat模型，包含Change Extraction模块来捕捉时间特征和空间语义变化，以及Prompt Augmentation机制来增强对空间细节的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明，BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过创新的模块设计有效解决了双时相图像分析中的时空建模问题，显著提升了变化理解能力。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个多模态深度学习框架，通过视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93%以上的准确率，超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，无法在复杂环境中可靠评估风险，需要开发能够融合多模态数据的解决方案。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块，包含细粒度注意力模块(FGAM)和多模态几何对应模块(MGCM)，使用视觉数据和骨骼坐标构建多模态数据集，基于REBA系统进行八类风险标注。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和MCC均为93%，RMSE为0.1205，MAE为0.0156，优于九种流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推动了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，在运动医学领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，通过压缩特征嵌入而非像素重建，在极低比特率（2-3*10^-3 bpp）下保持语义完整性，性能优于主流图像压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法注重像素级重建，但新兴应用更关注语义保持，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，这需要先进的语义压缩范式。

Method: 利用多模态基础模型CLIP的零样本和表征能力，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特，同时保持不同任务间的语义信息。

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3*10^-3 bpp，比主流图像压缩方法所需比特率少95%，在极端压缩下仍展现跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法在极低比特率下有效保持语义信息，具有出色的跨任务和跨数据分布的零样本鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键局限：过度依赖对比学习目标而忽视细粒度特征优化；所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 设计了属性检索模块，对每层视觉特征进行聚类，从提示池中检索语义相似的提示并连接到文本编码器的每一层输入。采用双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，并通过自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界实施的更可行解决方案，通过分层视觉信息和细粒度对齐显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Motivation: 在Flow Matching模型中应用强化学习时，需要通过SDE在确定性框架中注入随机性，但SDE采样会导致显著的噪声色彩，影响奖励学习过程和生成质量。

Method: 受DDIM启发，提出Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，重新定义采样过程，消除SDE导致的噪声色彩，保持系数一致性。

Result: CPS方法有效消除了噪声色彩，提高了奖励模型的准确性，使得Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO等强化学习优化器更快速、更稳定地收敛。

Conclusion: 该研究为在Flow Matching模型中应用强化学习提供了更有效的解决方案，CPS方法通过消除噪声色彩显著改善了图像生成质量和奖励学习性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上进行实验，数量和质量结果都显示方法的优势性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，提高医学影像分割的准确性，尤其在边界区域表现优异

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Conclusion: 通过优化3D医学形象的空间特征并采用解释性强的设计，方法在保持性能的同时有效提升了模型的可解释性

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Result: 在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Conclusion: 通过统一域对齐训练和测试数据，ConstStyle能有效减少领域偏移影响，特别适用于训练域有限或领域差距大的情况

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，分割信息的引入能有效提升单目3D检测性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的单目太空船位姿估计方法，结合运动感知热力图和光流技术，在SPADES-RGB和SPARK-2024数据集上实现了更优的2D关键点定位和6自由度位姿估计性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像位姿估计方法无法利用太空任务中的时序信息，需要开发能够抓取运动动态的方法来提升估计精度

Method: 采用人体位姿估计框架，结合Vision Transformer编码器和预训练光流模型，通过运动感知热力图和光流来定位2D关键点，最后使用PnP求解器恢复6自由度位姿

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上训练和评估，在真实和合成数据上进行测试，方法在2D关键点定位和6自由度位姿估计方面都显示出更优的性能，超越了单图像基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将运动动态信息集成到太空船位姿估计中，显示了良好的性能提升和演绎能力，为太空任务中的准确位姿估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的视觉问答框架，通过多候选答案生成、空间定位和思维链推理来处理视觉问题中的模糊性，在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片往往模糊或构图不佳，提出的视觉问题也经常模糊不清，存在多种有效答案，这与传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域的假设不匹配。

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样化候选答案，通过PolyFormer对每个答案进行空间定位，然后应用思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域。

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中，BLaVe-CoT优于先前方法，对辅助环境中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，代码已开源以促进进一步研究和可访问性应用。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Motivation: 现有的大规模开词汇目标检测预训练数据集主要是地面自然图像，与无人机图像存在显著领域差距，导致模型在无人机图像上性能大幅下降。

Method: 首先开发了改进的UAV-Label标注引擎，构建了包含200万实例和1800个类别的UAVDE-2M数据集以及15000张图像的UAVCAP-15k数据集。然后提出了跨注意力门控增强融合(CAGE)模块，并将其集成到YOLO-World-v2架构中。

Conclusion: 通过构建专门的无人机图像数据集和设计CAGE融合模块，成功解决了无人机图像开词汇目标检测中的领域适应问题，为无人机应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的细粒度动态感知(FDP)框架用于面部微表情识别，通过序列排序和动态图像构建来提升识别性能和解决数据稀缺问题。


<details>

Motivation: 微表情识别面临持续时间短、细微和动态性挑战，现有方法或需要关键帧或受限于小规模训练数据。

Method: 提出序列排序编码动态信息，使用局部-全局特征感知Transformer学习帧表征，通过排序评分器获取动态表征，并结合动态图像构建任务来提升表征学习。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上，F1分数分别提升了4.05%、2.50%、7.71%和2.11%，显著超过了最新方法。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过动态感知和动态图像构建，有效解决了微表情识别中的动态信息提取和数据稀缺问题，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Conclusion: DVLO4D通过稀疏时空融合有效解决了传统方法的局限性，在精度、鲁棒性和效率方面都表现出色，为自主系统定位提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the

Conclusion: 集成细节保持下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为基于无人机的电网小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from

enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements

Result: 在两个多任务数据集上的10个3D分割任务中 consistently outperforms SOTA微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%，在未见任务上验证了更好的迁移性

Conclusion: MedSeqFT建立了序列微调作为适应基础模型到演进临床任务的有效、知识保持范式

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了PathoHR-Bench基准测试来评估视觉语言模型在病理学领域的层次语义理解和组合推理能力，并开发了一种病理学特定的多模态对比学习训练方案，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像分析对自动化肿瘤诊断至关重要，但由于组织图像结构相似性高、形态变化细微，现有视觉语言模型难以捕捉解释结构化病理报告所需的复杂推理能力。

Method: 提出了PathoHR-Bench基准测试，并开发了一种病理学特定的视觉语言训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在细粒度病理表示方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型难以有效建模复杂的跨模态关系，限制了其在临床环境中的应用，而提出的病理学特定训练方案能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

*Giulia Bonino,Luca Alberto Rizzo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARDIE是一种无监督图像聚类算法，基于颜色和亮度特征进行聚类，能够生成对图像增强任务更有意义的聚类结果，并可用于重采样图像增强数据集以提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动图像聚类在计算机视觉中很重要，但现有方法难以定义对图像增强任务有意义的聚类，因为语义属性聚类与图像增强需求不匹配。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类；同时引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE生成的聚类比基于语义属性的聚类更适用于图像增强；利用CARDIE聚类重采样数据集可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更有效的聚类方法，能够改善图像增强算法的性能，代码已开源以促进采用和重现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

*Tang Sui,Songxi Yang,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，能够从多光谱图像生成高光谱图像，同时保持空间和光谱质量，在PSNR、SAM和SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，采用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，输入5个多光谱波段，重建224个高光谱波段。引入级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕获关系。

Result: 模型达到PSNR 35.82 dB、SAM 2.40°、SSIM 0.96，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6 dB PSNR，ERGAS减少一半以上。在下游任务如土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为相关应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

TL;DR: RetinaGuard是一个保护视网膜图像隐私的框架，通过对抗性掩蔽机制隐藏视网膜年龄信息，同时保持图像质量和疾病诊断价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权的使用可能导致生物信息泄露，需要保护个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制来模糊视网膜年龄信息，使用多对一知识蒸馏策略结合视网膜基础模型和多个替代年龄编码器，提供对黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Result: RetinaGuard成功模糊了视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示的影响最小，且可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物特征隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医疗诊断价值，具有很好的扩展性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

<details>

Motivation: 现有统一多模态理解生成模型在图像生成能力上虽有显著进步，但在指令跟随和细节保持方面仍与GPT-4o等紧密耦合理解与生成的系统存在较大差距

Method: 引入Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG)框架，交替进行基于文本的思考和图像合成；提出IRGL训练方法，构建IRGL-300K数据集，采用两阶段训练策略

Result: 在GenEval、WISE、TIIF、GenAI-Bench和OneIG-EN等基准测试中实现最先进性能，获得5-10个百分点的绝对增益，视觉质量和细粒度保真度显著提升

Conclusion: 交替推理方法能有效提升文本到图像生成的质量，IRG框架在保持语义的同时改善了细粒度细节、视觉质量和美学效果

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

TL;DR: UniVerse-1是一个统一的多模态生成模型，能够同时生成协调的音频和视频内容，通过专家模型融合技术和在线标注流程实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决音频-视频生成中训练效率低和标注对齐问题，避免从头训练带来的性能下降，同时充分利用预训练模型的基础能力。

Method: 采用专家拼接技术(SoE)，深度融合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型的对应模块；开发在线标注流程，在训练过程中处理训练数据并生成标签，避免基于文本标注的错位问题。

Result: 在约7,600小时的音频-视频数据上微调后，模型能够生成环境声音协调良好的音视频内容，并在语音生成方面实现强对齐效果；提出了Verse-Bench基准数据集进行系统评估。

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的模型融合和标注技术，在音视频生成任务上取得了显著进展，公开模型和代码以促进研究社区发展，缩小与Veo3等最先进模型的性能差距。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO是一个统一的单阶段框架，用于视频场景图生成，同时处理粗粒度框级和细粒度像素级任务，通过扩展槽注意机制和时序一致性学习实现高效的多粒度视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（框级或像素级），需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，使用扩展槽注意机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系槽，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Result: 在标准框级和像素级VidSGG基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，同时通过统一设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在视频场景图生成中的有效性，能够处理不同视觉粒度任务，减少任务特定修改，最大化参数共享。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Method: 开发了基于自定义卷积神经网络(CNN)的AI解决方案，并与EfficientNetB0、MobileNetV2、ResNet50等迁移学习模型进行对比。使用公开的FracAtlas数据集(4,083张肌骨X光片)进行训练

Result: 自定义CNN模型在FracAtlas数据集上达到了95.96%准确度、0.94精度、0.88召回率和0.91 F1分数。过传模型在这个特定设置下表现较差

Conclusion: 这项工作显示了轻量级CNN在X光骨折检测中的应用前景，并强调了公平性能测评、多样化数据集和外部验证对于临床转化的重要性

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在理解3D空间关系方面存在局限，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）依赖自我中心的多视角观测，需要更好的空间理解能力。

Method: 创建包含8,600+问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并开发Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过生成基于估计全局3D坐标的认知地图来增强空间推理。

Result: 基准测试显示当前VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在真实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进空间理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

Motivation: 皮肤屏障功能的定量指标（SH和TEWL）对皮肤健康监测很重要，但普通用户难以获得专业仪器测量。需要开发从自拍图像远程估计这些指标的便捷方法。

Method: 多阶段解决方案：包括数据收集、预处理，提出新颖的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型进行回归，并使用对称对比正则化解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 成功实现了从自拍面部图像估计SH和TEWL，通过对比正则化有效减少了模型偏差，是首个无需物理测量的皮肤评估研究。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究之间的空白，为更广泛的实际应用提供了AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析方案。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

TL;DR: PAML框架通过原型感知多模态学习解决视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的三大挑战：模态对齐不足、跨模态融合不充分、语义原型利用不佳，在标准场景表现优异并在开放词汇场景达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的视觉定位方法在标准场景表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含训练时未见的新物体类别）存在显著局限，主要由于三个关键因素：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分。

Method: 提出PAML框架：1)使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐；2)视觉判别特征编码器增强显著物体表示；3)新颖的原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；4)多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合和边界框回归。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的大量实验验证了方法的有效性，在标准场景表现具有竞争力，在开放词汇场景达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性地解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的性能，为处理新颖物体类别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了视频领域的广义类别发现(Video-GCD)问题，设计了一种新的内存导向一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时空线索和全局上下文来提高新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅依靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升发现性能。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性导向对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数，并用于加权对比损失。MGRE通过双级内存缓冲区维护特征层和逻辑层表征，提供全局上下文。

Result: 在行为识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了涉广实验，结果显示该方法显著超过了来自图像基础设置的竞争性GCD方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作显示了时间信息对于视频中发现新类别的重要性，提供了一个新的视频-GCD基准测试集，代码将公开。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Text4Seg和Text4Seg++模型，通过文本作为掩码的新范式，将图像分割转化为文本生成问题，无需额外解码器，在多种视觉任务中实现强大的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但如何有效整合图像分割仍是一个重大挑战。需要简化分割过程并提高效率。

Method: 提出语义描述符作为分割掩码的文本表示，包括图像级和框级语义描述符。引入行级游程编码(R-RLE)压缩冗余文本，加速推理。Text4Seg++将分割制定为下一砖块预测任务。

Result: 在自然和遥感数据集上的综合实验表明，Text4Seg++在各种基准测试中始终优于最先进模型，无需任务特定微调，且与现有MLLM主干兼容。R-RLE将语义描述符长度减少74%，推理加速3倍。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了在MLLM框架内文本驱动图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和泛化能力，为简化分割流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Motivation: 现有货币识别系统通常忽视可用性和真实性评估，特别是在低资源环境中，视觉障碍用户和离线验证需求普遍，现有方法主要关注面额分类而忽略物理损坏和伪造问题。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新颖的统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)进行损坏量化，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测，数据集包含82,000多张标注图像。

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and

TL;DR: 提出了GO-Tokenizer方法，通过利用现成的目标检测器为视频大语言模型编码紧凑的目标信息，提升时间敏感视频理解能力，在多个任务上优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧中的目标信息中受益，但直接将目标文本描述加入提示会带来额外token长度和对噪声敏感的问题

Method: 提出GO-Tokenizer轻量级附加模块，使用现成目标检测器实时编码紧凑目标信息，避免文本描述带来的问题

Result: 实验表明，使用GO-Tokenizer预训练的模型在推理时间定位和密集描述等任务上优于原始视频大语言模型和使用文本目标描述的方法

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer能有效提升视频大语言模型的时间敏感视频理解能力，且具有良好的泛化性

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的人脸反欺骗方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)，利用多个释义文本生成泛化特征

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了现有最先进方法，表现出优异的泛化性能

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多文本表示和补丁对齐机制，有效提升了人脸反欺骗的跨域泛化能力

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR

integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide

benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Motivation: 在大型场景中，3DGS的输入视图来自有限空间区域，重建主要适用于相同区域的新视角（3DoF+）。位置量化误差会导致投影误差，且该误差与投影点距离的平方倒数成正比。

Method: 提出基于球坐标的量化方案，通过分析位置误差对像素投影误差的影响，设计更有效的坐标表示方法。

Result: 在著名的Garden场景上展示了所提方法的率失真性能，验证了量化方案的有效性。

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案能够有效降低3DGS在大型场景中的投影误差，提升3DoF+视角下的重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

### [178] [Phantom-Insight: Adaptive Multi-cue Fusion for Video Camouflaged Object Detection with Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06422)
*Hua Zhang,Changjiang Luo,Ruoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一种基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测新方法，通过动态前景视觉令牌评分和提示网络增强目标边缘细节分离能力，采用解耦的前景-背景学习策略提高目标与背景的分离性，在MoCA-Mask数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有VCOD方法的两个主要问题：SAM方法因模型冻结而难以分离伪装目标边缘，MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景和背景而导致目标分离性差。

Method: 1) 使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合增加信息密度；2) 通过动态前景视觉令牌评分模块和提示网络生成多个线索，自适应指导和微调SAM模型；3) 提出解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Result: 在MoCA-Mask数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CAD2016数据集上展示了检测未见伪装目标的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标-背景分离问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: 首次提供无需标注的牛鼻检测解决方案，为畜牧业监测应用提供了更灵活、可扩展的实用替代方案

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中性能下降，现有增强方法需要额外训练、依赖外部分割工具或操作粒度较粗，忽视了VLMs内在的能力。

Method: 提出CARVE方法：分析VLMs注意力模式，发现视觉复杂度与注意力熵相关；通过对比通用查询和任务特定查询的注意力图，在像素级别分解视觉信号为语义信号和视觉噪声；无需训练即可提取任务相关视觉信号。

Result: 广泛实验表明CARVE能持续提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Motivation: 探索前沿视觉基础模型在专业领域（如医学形态学）的效能转移能力，研究DINOv3是否可以作为统一编码器直接应用于医学视觉任务而无需领域特定预训练。

Method: 在广泛的医学形态学模态上对DINOv3进行基准测试，包括2D/3D分类和分割任务，系统分析模型规模和输入分辨率对性能的影响。

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域-空域协同的框架设计，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化和特征融合问题，为高分辨率遥感图像变化检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Conclusion: TIDE框架有效解决了主题驱动图像生成中的关键挑战，具有很好的泛化能力，可应用于结构条件生成、图像到图像生成等多种任务。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated

*Hua Chang Bakker,Stan Fris,Angela Madelon Bernardy,Stan Deutekom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对FairCLIP的可复现性研究发现原文实现与描述不一致，新实现A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+均未能证明FairCLIP在零样本青光眼分类任务中改善性能和公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可复现性，并研究如何通过最小化Sinkhorn距离来改善CLIP模型在敏感组别间的公平性

Method: 重现原实验设置，发现原实现与描述不一致后开发了A-FairCLIP对比研究，提出FairCLIP+扩展多属性优化，分析距离最小化对公平性和性能的影响

Result: 虽然CLIP在医疗扫描图像零样本分类中存在偏见，但实验结果不支持FairCLIP能改善性能和公平性的断言，正式实现和A-FairCLIP均未在青光眼分类任务中展现改善效果

Conclusion: 距离最小化目标虽能降低Sinkhorn距离，但无法有效提升CLIP在零样本医疗图像分类任务中的公平性和性能，对FairCLIP的效果提出质疑

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Motivation: 解决快速移动小型物体(FMO)追踪的挑战，需要更丰富的标注信息和标准化的评估方法来支持机器学习管道的发展。

Method: 创建FMOX JSON元数据文件，扩充FMO数据集的物体大小信息；使用EfficientTAM基础追踪模型在FMOX上进行测试；采用轨迹交并比(TIoU)指标进行性能评估。

Result: EfficientTAM模型在FMO数据集上表现与专门为FMO设计的管道相当，证明了FMOX格式的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: FMOX元数据文件为FMO追踪领域提供了可访问、可重用的标准化工具，支持了基础模型在小型物体追踪任务上的应用和评估。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对场景级草图检索的训练方法，通过预训练、编码器架构和损失函数的适当组合，在不增加额外复杂度的情况下实现最先进性能，强调对草图模糊性和噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景级草图检索中真实草图固有的模糊性和噪声问题，传统方法主要关注检索模型的架构增强，而忽视了草图本身的变异性。

Method: 采用适当的预训练策略、编码器架构和损失函数设计，明确构建对草图变异性的鲁棒性训练目标，不引入额外复杂度。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行大量实验，证实了方法的有效性，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，同时指出需要改进场景级草图检索的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RARL方法解决增量开放集识别问题，通过角度空间表示学习和虚拟-内在交互训练策略，在连续数据流中有效识别新出现的未知类别并保持决策边界判别性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法主要针对静态场景，无法有效处理连续数据流中不断出现的新未知类别，导致决策边界判别性下降和严重的类间混淆问题

Method: 提出保持性角度表示学习(RARL)，在等角紧框架下构建角度空间，使未知表示围绕非活跃原型对齐；采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近端虚拟类增强类间间隔；设计分层校正策略缓解表示偏差和特征空间扭曲

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，建立了IOSR新基准，在各种任务设置下均实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和决策边界退化问题，为动态环境下的开放集识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种机器学习方法，通过近似Condorcet排序来学习降维排序，用于构建彩色图像的向量值形态学算子


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在向量值图像处理中缺乏统一的向量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习降维排序，近似Condorcet排序（基于投票问题的排序方法，将不同排序视为投票者）

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习降维映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为解决向量值数学形态学中的排序问题提供了有效的机器学习解决方案

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

TL;DR: CausNVS是一个自回归的多视角扩散模型，支持任意输入输出视角配置，通过序列化生成视角来解决现有方法固定视角数量和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了其在世界建模中的应用，因为它们只支持固定数量的视角，并且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢。

Method: 采用自回归设置，使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，结合成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时使用空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现了灵活的自回归新视角合成，并在多样化设置下保持了一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型的限制，为3D新视角合成提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Motivation: 数字化市场和社交媒体中的不可持续野生动物贸易对生物多样性构成严重威胁，需要自动化方法来检测这些贸易清单

Method: 使用被罕运或没收的象牙、狮绣、虎制品图片进行训练，研究了不同训练策略和损失函数的组合，开发了单个模型识别三种物种产品

Result: 最佳模型总体准确率84.2%，象、狮绣、虎产品分别达到71.1%、90.2%、93.5%，手机应用准确率91.3%

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于网络贸易监测，还可在实体市场中应用，为政府部门和执法机构提供了可行的监测工具

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，用于低强度CT和PET图像的去噪处理，在保持轻量化模型的同时实现了更优的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低强度CT和PET虽然减少了放射风险，但导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性。需要去噪技术来提升图像质量同时保持放射安全。

Method: 设计了混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块和混合上采样模块。EGA模块增强空间和通道维度的相互作用，混合上采样模块减少对噪声的过拟合风险。

Result: 在公开的LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet实现了更优的去噪性能，同时保持轻量化模型规模，适合在标准内存配置的GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床应用提供了高度实用的解决方案，能够在保持放射安全的前提下有效提升低强度CT/PET图像的质量。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: 植物在自然环境中通常面临多种交互影响的逆境，特别是氮稠缺乏与干旱、杂草竞争的维合压力，早期检测氮稠压力对保护植物健康至关重要

Method: 提出一种新的深度学习框架，使用RGB、多光谱和两种红外波长四种成像模态获取植物生理响应。构建空间-时间深度学习管线，结合CNN提取空间特征和LSTM捕捉时间依赖关系

Result: CNN-LSTM模型达到了98%的高准确率，显著超越了单纯空间CNN模型的80.45%和以往机器学习方法的76%准确率

Conclusion: 该研究为及时预防急急识别氮稠压力严重程度提供了一个有前景的强壁平台，能够有效捕捉氮稠缺乏、水分压力和杂草压力之间细微而复杂的交互作用，促进更好的作物管理和植物健康

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Motivation: 高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究建议位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集中的好处待探索。

Method: 评估位置基于正则化对六个最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括具有不同隐藏空间维度的卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉变换器(ViT)模型。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行评估。

Result: 位置正则化持续改善了下游分类性能，CNN和ViT的F1分数平均分别提高4.9±4.0%和6.3±8.9%。位置正则化的SSL在低维隐藏表征中对CNN的改善效果更为显著，而高维ViT模型显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，尤其在使用低维隐藏表征时，并证明了高维ViT在海底图像分析中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Motivation: 解决长时间海底AUV在实时情况下的图像解释需求，克服传统离线方法需要完整数据集和人工标注的限制

Conclusion: OCF框架具有优秀的聚类能力和稳健性，适合生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持久自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要精确深度信息，通常依赖RGB-D或立体相机，但这些设备深度感知范围有限，难以处理大场景。单目图像缺乏深度指导，导致新视角合成效果不佳。虽然大基础模型可用于单目深度估计，但存在跨帧不一致、远距离场景不准确和纹理欺骗等问题。

Method: 利用视觉惯性SfM提供的准确但稀疏的深度来优化大基础模型生成的密集但粗糙的深度。提出对象分割深度传播算法来处理结构化对象的深度渲染，并开发动态深度细化模块来处理动态对象的SfM深度缺陷。

Result: 在公开和定制数据集上的实验表明，VIM-GS在大场景中具有优越的渲染质量。

Conclusion: VIM-GS成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，通过结合稀疏和密集深度信息的优势，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：合成的异常缺乏精细纹理细节且难以与背景精确对齐，以及无法生成细粒度的像素级异常。这些问题限制了异常分割性能的提升。

Method: STAGE采用分级扩散框架，引入干净背景信息作为先验来引导去噪分布，使用异常分支显式记录局部异常，并通过显式掩码对齐策略逐步将合成异常与背景对齐。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，并有效提升了下游异常分割任务的表现。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

TL;DR: Zo3T是一个零样本测试时训练框架，通过3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导的LoRA适配器和引导场校正，实现了高质量的轨迹引导图像到视频生成，无需大量标注数据和微调。

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过创新的3D感知技术和测试时自适应机制，成功解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的真实性和对齐问题，为无需大量标注数据的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: 通过协同组织分割和细胞核分割任务，Co-Seg框架能够实现相互增强，显著提升病理图像分析性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Conclusion: 该系统在实验室和真实雨林环境中都表现出优异的深度估计、RGB重建和材料区分能力，为轻量化、集成化的无人机感知和数据采集在复杂自然环境中的应用推广了道路

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Motivation: 事件相机虽然具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围等优势，但成本高、分辨率有限且缺乏自动对焦等功能，限制了其在早期开发和原型设计中的广泛应用。

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器(ISP)，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，设计支持原始数据、RGB和事件流同步记录的数据采集管道。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D

such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the

interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly

our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CG基于方法缺乏多样性，而学习基于方法又受限于特定对象类别和数据需求，无法满足自动驾驶感知训练对稀有场景的大规模需求

Method: 提出一种可扩展的real2sim2real系统，利用3D生成技术自动化资产挖掘、生成和稀有案例数据合成

Result: 该方法能够生成更多样化的缓存场景，充分满足自动驾驶感知系统对稀有案例的训练需求

Conclusion: 通过3D生成技术构建的real2sim2real系统，有效解决了传统任感器模拟方法在多样性、可扩展性和通用性方面的局限性

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

*Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMO是一个统一的多身份优化框架，通过多对多匹配范式和强化学习来解决图像定制中的身份混淆问题，显著提高身份一致性并减少混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对脸部更敏感，现有图像定制方法在多参考图像下难以保持身份一致性且容易产生身份混淆，限制了身份可扩展性。

Method: 提出UMO框架，将多身份生成重新定义为全局分配优化问题，通过扩散模型的强化学习实现多身份一致性，并构建了包含合成和真实数据的多参考图像数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在多个图像定制方法上都取得了改进，在身份保持维度上达到了开源方法的新SOTA。

Conclusion: UMO有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份混淆问题，提供了可扩展的身份保持解决方案，为图像定制领域带来了重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用对比学习和混合架构（CNN+LSTM+注意力机制）实现视频年龄分级分类，在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率，并部署为实时Web应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视频年龄分级方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差和特征学习效率低的问题，满足流媒体平台自动化内容合规需求

Method: 采用三种对比学习框架（实例判别、上下文对比、多视图对比），结合LRCN（CNN+LSTM）骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，使用NT-Xent等对比损失函数

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下取得最佳性能：88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够精细区分PG-13和R级内容

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构结合对比学习在视频年龄分级任务中表现出色，已部署为实时Web应用，为流媒体平台提供高效的内容合规解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要基于单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态和疾病谱。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Result: Curia在器官识别、脑出血和心肌梗死等疾病检测、肿瘤分期预测等任务中表现优异，性能达到或超过放射科医生和最新基础模型，在跨模态和低数据场景下展现出临床显著的新兴特性。

Conclusion: Curia展示了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为加速该领域进展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过迁移学习调整通用基础模型，并整合手术室中的互补模态数据来支持外科数据科学，特别是在微创手术支持方面的应用。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础，构建多模态模型。通过(a)在未标记外科视频数据上微调，(b)整合手术室额外时间解析数据流，分析下游任务性能。在肝脏手术视频数据集上预测住院时间和术后并发症，在HeiCo数据集上进行手术阶段识别。

Result: 领域特定数据微调能提升模型性能。在内部数据上，整合额外时间序列数据同样有益。在HeiCo数据上，预训练单模态基线设置与EndoVis2017挑战赛最佳表现相当，领域特定数据微调进一步提高了准确率。

Conclusion: 外科数据科学可以利用公共通用基础模型，领域适应和整合合适的互补数据流具有巨大潜力。研究发布了代码和模型权重以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Method: 使用LISA交通标志数据集训练卷积神经网络分类47种交通标志，评估其对FGSM和PGD对抗性攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 随着扰动幅度的增加，分类准确率出现急剧下降，表明模型容易受到对抗性样本的攻击。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While
prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper
investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA
Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47
different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a
sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude
increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This
study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms
tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and
fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in
marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,
increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动评分类风湿性关节炎严重程度耗时且主观性强，存在观察者间和观察者内变异性问题。

Method: 使用970名患者数据，采用四步框架：ResNet50图像预处理、UNet.3手部分割、YOLOv7关节识别、多种深度学习模型进行TSS预测，包括VGG、ResNet、DenseNet、EfficientNet和ViT。

Conclusion: ARTSS框架能够有效自动化RA严重程度评估，提高识别准确性、节省时间并支持临床决策，具有重要临床应用价值。

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

TL;DR: 提出一种拓扑自适应的变形模型，用于处理包含拓扑伪影的非刚性3D网格匹配问题，能够在ARAP和双射关联约束下对齐形状对，无需数据驱动先验即可处理高度非等距形状和拓扑伪影。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中多视角重建常出现的拓扑伪影问题，当前方法基于等距变形或ARAP变形的假设在这些拓扑配置下失效。

Method: 提出拓扑自适应变形模型，联合优化具有适当拓扑的模板网格及其与待匹配形状的对齐，在ARAP和双射关联约束下提取对应关系。

Result: 方法适用于高度非等距形状和含拓扑伪影的形状，包括噪声多视角重建，在3D对齐质量上甚至优于基于大数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该拓扑自适应方法能够有效处理传统假设失效的拓扑配置，为含拓扑伪影的3D网格匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别(ALPR)在智慧城市中扮演重要角色，但因其高变化性而面临挑战。对于模糊车牌图像的处理尤其困难，需要更有效的深度学习方法来提高识别准确性和实时性

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测(LPD)、字符分割(CS)和字符识别(CR)。选择性预处理避免了不必要的输入操作

Conclusion: 综合使用YOLOv5和Deblur-GAN的方案能够在保持实时性的同时实现高精度识别，特别适合处理模糊场景，为可穿戴应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和患者无关场景中均获得优越的准确性

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球面特征空间中的相似性学习能够更好地捕捉复杂流形结构，提高配准精度和收敛速度

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat是首个作物领域视觉基础模型，通过自监督在最大小麦图像数据集ImAg4Wheat上预训练，在10个田间视觉任务中优于通用预训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业领域泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型

Method: 使用自监督学习方法在ImAg4Wheat数据集（250万张高分辨率小麦图像，覆盖2000+基因型和500+环境条件）上预训练小麦专用基础模型

Result: FoMo4Wheat模型在冠层和器官级别的10个田间视觉任务中一致优于最先进的通用预训练模型，且表示具有鲁棒性和跨作物可迁移性

Conclusion: 作物特定基础模型对可靠田间感知具有重要价值，为构建具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

TL;DR: H₂OT是一种分层插换式剪枝-恢复框架，通过动态剪枝重复帧的姿态令牌来提高视频3D人体姿势估计变化器的效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频姿态变化器(VPTs)计算成本高、在资源受限设备上不实用的问题。

Method: 使用令牌剪枝模块(TPM)动态选择代表性帧的少量令牌，通过令牌恢复模块(TRM)恢复详细时空信息，实现从简化序列到原始分辨率的快速推理。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和效率，既提高了效率又保持了估计准确性。

Conclusion: 维护完整姿态序列不是必要的，少量代表性帧的姿态令牌即可实现高效率和高准确性的视频3D人体姿势估计。

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Motivation: 代码转换对通用自动语音识别系统构成重大挑战，现有方法难以捕捉代码转换场景中细微的音韵变化，特别是在越南语-英语这种具有独特音韵特征和相似声音识别模糊性的语言对中。

Method: 采用双阶段音素中心架构，基于扩展的越南语音素集作为中间表示来促进混合语言建模，实现音素适应和语言转换。

Result: TSPC在越南语-英语代码转换ASR中 consistently优于现有基线(包括PhoWhisper-base)，词错误率显著降低至20.8%，且训练资源需求减少。

Conclusion: 基于音素的双阶段架构能够通过音素适应和语言转换来增强复杂代码转换场景下的ASR性能，为越南语-英语代码转换语音识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle
phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly
difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct
phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition
are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC
employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme
set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing
baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a
significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources.
Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme
adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS
Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估人工智能代理是否能够真正替代真实参与者进行人类主体研究，重点关注代理的内部一致性而非仅是表面的回答匹配度。

Method: 设计了一个研究方案，包括(a)揭示代理的内部状态，(b)在基础对话环境中检验代理行为，通过一系列行为偏向假设来评估代理的对话行为是否与其揭示的内部状态一致。

Result: 在不同模型家族和不同模型大小上都发现了显著的内部不一致性。虽然代理可能生成与人类对应者相似的回答，但无法保持内部一致性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在准确替代真实参与者进行人类主体研究方面存在严重的能力缺口，其内部不一致性是一个关键问题。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

TL;DR: REER是一种新的深度推理范式，通过从已知优秀解决方案反向工程推理过程，解决了开放创造性生成中的推理难题，超越了传统RL和蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度推理方法（强化学习和指令蒸馏）在开放创造性生成任务中存在明显局限：RL缺乏清晰奖励信号，蒸馏方法成本高昂且受限于教师模型能力。

Method: 提出REER（反向工程推理）范式，从已知优秀解决方案反向计算发现潜在的逐步深度推理过程，采用可扩展的无梯度方法，并构建了DeepWriting-20K大规模数据集。

Result: 基于该数据训练的DeepWriter-8B模型不仅超越了强大的开源基线，而且在性能上与GPT-4o和Claude 3.5等领先专有模型竞争甚至有时更优。

Conclusion: REER范式为开放创造性生成任务提供了一种有效的新方法，通过反向工程推理过程解决了传统方法的局限性，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

TL;DR: EDIT方法通过约束引导生成和动态推理修剪，帮助大型推理模型找到简洁正确的推理路径，解决过度思考问题，提高推理效率和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在处理简单问题时容易过度思考，产生冗长复杂的推理路径，影响可解释性和用户体验。研究发现LRMs难以平衡正确性和简洁性等多个生成目标。

Method: 提出EDIT测试时缩放方法，采用约束引导生成，同时跟踪不同约束下的长度和答案分布，选择在简洁性和正确性之间达到最优平衡的响应。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDIT显著提高了推理效率，产生紧凑且信息丰富的输出，改善了可读性和用户体验。

Conclusion: EDIT方法有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，通过动态推理修剪实现了推理路径的优化，在保持正确性的同时大幅提升了输出简洁性。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Method: 研究者开发了VehicleWorld环境，包含30个模块、250个API和680个属性。通过系统分析发现直接状态预测更适合环境控制，并提出了State-based Function Call (SFC)方法，维护显式系统状态意识和实现直接状态迁移。

Result: 实验结果显示，SFC方法显著超过传统FC方法，实现了更高的执行准确性和更低的延迟。

Conclusion: 这项研究为汽车领域的API代理提供了有效的解决方案，SFC方法通过状态基础的控制方式显著提升了系统性能，并已开源公布代码。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on

Motivation: 当前的长时程多组件LLM代理系统评估方法存在局限，主要关注单一指标或端到端结果，难以识别系统具体故障点和原因。需要能够推理、探测、迭代并理解系统复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含一个中央Judge系统性地调查故障，以及一组专门Evaluators评估系统组件和Judge自身的推理质量，建立假设历史记录。

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的代理-步骤故障对准确率（相比之前最佳16.6%大幅提升），在手工制作数据集上达到20%以上（超越之前最佳8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES代表了向自主系统自动化故障检测迈出的关键一步，相比劳动密集型人工审查具有显著优势。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Method: 使用12个推理模型在2个知识密集测试集上进行综合评估，分析测试时计算量增加对准确性和幻觉的影响

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能持续提高准确性，在许多情况下反而导致更多幻觉；延长推理使模型更容易选择放弃回答，而非改善事实记忆

Conclusion: 虽然存在限制，但启用深度思考仍然比不思考更有益；延长推理可能导致确认偏见，产生过份自信的幻觉

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

Method: 提出CogEdit基准评估三个元认知层次，并开发MIND框架：构建元知识记忆实现自我意识，使用博弈论交互监控知识激活，采用标签精炼进行噪声鲁棒更新。

Result: 大量实验表明MIND框架显著优于现有认知编辑方法，在传统和元认知知识编辑基准上都取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: CogEdit基准和MIND框架有效填补了元认知知识编辑的空白，为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面的知识编辑评估和改进方法。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Motivation: 确保多语言信息检索系统的语言公平性，使语义相同的不同语言查询在同一多语言文档集上能获得等效的排序结果。

Method: 使用传统检索方法和基于mBERT、XLM-R的DPR神经排序器评估公平性，并提出LaKDA损失函数来减轻神经MLIR方法中的语言偏见。

Result: 分析揭示了当前MLIR技术中存在内在语言偏见，不同检索方法间存在显著差异，LaKDA能有效提升语言公平性。

Conclusion: 多语言信息检索系统存在语言公平性问题，需要专门的方法如LaKDA来缓解语言偏见，确保跨语言信息获取的公平性。

Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is
crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages.
This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in
different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent
ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate
the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR
neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a
novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our
analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with
notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of
LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条纹投影的建筑高度同步系统，用于激光指向能量汇聚制造过程中的层次表面重建，并通过几何基于点云指标自动识别制造缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指向能量汇聚制造过程容易产生几何偏差、未融合和表面累粗等缺陷，需要一种能够实时监测和识别这些缺陷的方法。

Method: 开发了建筑高度同步的条纹投影系统，达到了±46μm的重建精度。从重建的3D形态中，引入了两种补充的几何点云指标：局部点密度（标记表面累粗）和法向变化率（识别未融合特征）。

Result: 系统能够在不需要手动标注的情况下，自动化识别常见的沉积异常现象，并实现了精确的异常定位。

Conclusion: 该方法将几何偏差与缺陷形成直接联系起来，推进了闭环过程控制的可行性，并将条纹投影确立为DED制造中微米级监测的实用工具。

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: SKEL是一个新的参数化3D人体模型，通过将SMPL模型重新绑定到生物力学准确的骨骼结构上，解决了现有模型在生物力学准确性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体模型（如SMPL）具有简化的运动学结构，与真实人体骨骼系统的关节位置和关节活动不符，限制了其在生物力学中的应用。需要一种具有生物力学准确骨骼结构且易于摆姿的参数化3D人体模型。

Method: 1）通过优化AMASS序列中的SMPL网格内的生物力学准确骨骼来构建数据集；2）学习从SMPL网格顶点到优化关节位置和骨骼旋转的回归器；3）用新的运动学参数重新参数化SMPL网格。

Result: SKEL模型具有比SMPL更生物力学准确的关节位置，骨骼更好地贴合在体表内部。能够将现有的人体姿态和形状数据集"升级"为包含生物力学参数。

Conclusion: SKEL提供了一个新工具，使野外生物力学成为可能，同时为视觉和图形研究人员提供了更好约束和更真实的人体关节模型。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

Public resources are still limited because of ethical, legal, and privacy
concerns, even though realistic datasets are necessary to support research and
tool developments. To address this gap, we introduce ForensicsData, an
extensive Question-Context-Answer (Q-C-A) dataset sourced from actual malware

large language models (LLMs) to transform it into Q-C-A format, and then uses a
specialized evaluation process to confirm its quality. Among the models
evaluated, Gemini 2 Flash demonstrated the best performance in aligning
generated content with forensic terminology. ForensicsData aims to advance
digital forensics by enabling reproducible experiments and fostering

TL;DR: BinaryShield是一个隐私保护的威胁情报系统，通过PII脱敏、语义嵌入、二进制量化和随机响应机制生成不可逆的攻击指纹，实现跨合规边界的安全共享，在保持高检测性能的同时显著提升存储和搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署多个LLM服务处理数十亿查询，但监管合规边界阻止了这些服务共享提示注入攻击的威胁情报，导致攻击在一个服务中被检测后，在其他服务中可能数月未被发现。

Method: 通过结合PII脱敏、语义嵌入、二进制量化和随机响应机制的独特流水线，将可疑提示转换为非可逆指纹，在保护隐私的同时保留攻击模式。

Result: BinaryShield达到F1分数0.94，显著优于隐私保护基线SimHash（0.77），同时实现64倍存储减少和38倍更快的相似性搜索。

Conclusion: BinaryShield有效解决了LLM服务间威胁情报共享的隐私合规问题，在保持高检测准确性的同时大幅提升了系统效率。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a
critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services
handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries
prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection
attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one
service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as
privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence
system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance
boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique
pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and
randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible
fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our
evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94,
significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline,
while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared
to dense embeddings.

Motivation: 内部威胁检测研究受限于静态和访问受限的数据集，阻碍了自适应检测模型的发展，需要新的方法来生成动态合成数据。

Method: 使用Claude Sonnet 3.7大型语言模型动态合成高度不平衡（1%内部威胁）的系统日志消息，然后使用Claude Sonnet 3.7和GPT-4o分析日志中的内部威胁，并通过精确率、召回率、MCC和ROC AUC等统计指标评估性能。

Result: Claude Sonnet 3.7在几乎所有指标上都持续优于GPT-4o，特别是在减少误报和提高检测准确性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了大型语言模型在合成数据集生成和内部威胁检测方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of
identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is
dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological,
and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been
generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which
restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a
novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)
Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which
contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world
data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs
were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with
their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,
recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across
nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving
detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in
synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

Conclusion: 该方法为解决合成媒体溯源问题提供了有效的可解释水印解决方案，能够重建媒体变换链并揭示潜在证据。

Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and
fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an
infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a
multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,
including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that
recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape
viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control
perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for
forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing
deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This
study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation
chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking
system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of
transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks
are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner
that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These
watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same
transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when
subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer
the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of
composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of
tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and
traceability.

Conclusion: 1D信号转换方法优于传统的2D图像方法，为未来恶意软件分类模型提供了新的信号模态处理方式，具有更好的分类性能和更少的信息损失。

Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in
cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional
static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be
deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these
limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically
reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These
images can then be classified based on their textural information using
computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware
more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D
images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,
caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D
dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal
limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work
addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which
avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not
suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.
It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to
classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D
convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and
squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and
evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of
0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to
operate on the proposed signal modality.

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable
alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully
classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards
increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as
encoded tags. Our primary contribution is a multi-label Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced
reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a
small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability
to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using
adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for
single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and
limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing
acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and
their accurate and robust detection and classification.

Conclusion: ProtSAE通过语义引导有效解决了SAE的语义纠缠问题，为蛋白质语言模型的机制解释提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic
interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein
language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful
features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic
entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts,
making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike
existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret
activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both
annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled
attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns
more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to
previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE
maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in
interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs
for downstream generation tasks.

Conclusion: 词汇内容在语音情感识别中具有重要作用，能够达到竞争性甚至更优的性能，为语音情感识别研究提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Although paralinguistic cues are often considered the primary drivers of
speech emotion recognition (SER), we investigate the role of lexical content
extracted from speech and show that it can achieve competitive and in some
cases higher performance compared to acoustic models. On the MELD dataset, our
lexical-based approach obtains a weighted F1-score (WF1) of 51.5%, compared to
49.3% for an acoustic-only pipeline with a larger parameter count. Furthermore,
we analyze different self-supervised (SSL) speech and text representations,
conduct a layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluate the
effect of audio denoising.

TL;DR: Beamforming-LLM是一个结合空间音频捕获和检索增强生成技术的系统，能够通过自然语言查询帮助用户回忆错过的多说话人对话内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多说话人环境中用户可能错过重要对话内容的问题，为用户提供智能的听觉记忆辅助系统。

Method: 使用麦克风阵列进行空间音频捕获，通过波束成形分离定向音频流，用Whisper进行转录，使用句子编码器嵌入向量数据库，最后通过轻量级大语言模型(GPT-4o-mini)进行检索和摘要生成。

Result: 开发出用户友好的界面，提供对比摘要、空间上下文和时间戳音频回放功能。

Conclusion: 该工作为智能听觉记忆系统奠定了基础，在辅助技术、会议摘要和情境感知个人空间计算等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present Beamforming-LLM, a system that enables users to semantically
recall conversations they may have missed in multi-speaker environments. The
system combines spatial audio capture using a microphone array with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to support natural language queries such
as, "What did I miss when I was following the conversation on dogs?"
Directional audio streams are separated using beamforming, transcribed with
Whisper, and embedded into a vector database using sentence encoders. Upon
receiving a user query, semantically relevant segments are retrieved,
temporally aligned with non-attended segments, and summarized using a
lightweight large language model (GPT-4o-mini). The result is a user-friendly
interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context, and timestamped
audio playback. This work lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory
systems and has broad applications in assistive technology, meeting
summarization, and context-aware personal spatial computing.

### [257] [Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06941)
*Yuda Song,Julia Kempe,Remi Munos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 强化学习虽然能提升大语言模型的推理准确性，但会导致生成多样性下降。研究提出基于结果的探索方法，通过历史探索和批次探索两种算法，在保持准确性的同时维持多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于结果的强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时导致的生成多样性丧失问题，这对于实际部署中的测试时扩展至关重要。

Method: 提出基于结果的探索方法：1）历史探索 - 使用UCB风格奖励鼓励罕见答案；2）批次探索 - 惩罚批次内重复以促进测试时多样性。

Result: 在标准数学竞赛数据集上使用Llama和Qwen模型的实验表明，两种方法都能在提高准确性的同时缓解多样性崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 基于结果的探索为强化学习方法提供了一条实用路径，既能增强推理能力，又不牺牲可扩展部署所必需的多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

*Xiang Yuan,Jun Shu,Deyu meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离，并引入一致性正则化来提升OOD鲁棒性，在各种CLIP骨干网络上都能一致提升下游任务的ID性能和OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒微调方法（如保留预训练权重、特征或logits）不能总是改善不同模型架构的OOD鲁棒性，因为这些方法可能无法很好地代理函数空间中的优化。

Method: 提出两种正则化：1）在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离，使用模拟的OOD样本；2）引入一致性正则化来促进扰动样本的稳定预测。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种CLIP骨干网络上都能一致提升下游任务的ID性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中直接约束模型行为并增强预测一致性，能够有效保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时在下游任务上获得良好的性能。

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，通过分析静态指标和动态性能数据来自动化模型压缩，在保持精度的同时显著减少内存使用和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有压缩技术大多使用统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建模块化多智能体系统，结合静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）进行分析，实现结构化剪枝和训练后动态量化。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，剪枝保持竞争力或提升精度（ImageNet-1K下降约1%，小数据集上ViT-B/16提升2%），量化实现高达74%内存节省和1.74倍推理加速，精度损失<0.5%。

Conclusion: 智能体系统可作为可扩展的配置文件引导模型优化解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测被期望能通过预测集大小来捕捉偶然不确定性，但缺乏实证证据验证其有效性。本研究旨在调查共形预测器量化数据集中间类重叠导致的固有歧义性的能力

Method: 使用三种共形预测方法为八个深度学习模型生成预测集，在四个包含多人标注（5-50人）的数据集上进行实验。通过测量预测集大小与人类标注者标注的标签数量之间的相关性来评估效果

Result: 绝大多数共形预测输出与人类标注之间呈现非常弱到弱的相关性，只有少数显示中等相关性。虽然共形预测能提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但捕捉偶然不确定性的能力有限

Conclusion: 需要重新评估共形预测器生成的预测集的有效性。虽然它们能确保高概率覆盖真实类别，但在捕捉偶然不确定性方面的能力仍然有限，需要批判性地重新审视

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络经常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重构损失只能提供间接证据，无法将冗余作为故障模式进行隔离

Method: 通过分析从潜在表示导出的耦合矩阵，并利用能量距离将其非对角线统计量与正态分布进行比较，构建冗余指数ρ(C)

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证了ρ(C)，低ρ(C)可靠预测高分类准确率或低重构误差，而高冗余与性能崩溃相关

Conclusion: ρ(C)揭示了冗余作为跨模型和任务的通用瓶颈，为评估和改进学习表示的效率提供了理论视角和实用工具，可用于神经架构搜索和冗余感知正则化

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Conclusion: Persona提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过原型化的参数编辑框架实现设备模型的动态适应和演化，无需昂贵的重新训练过程。

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉-语言模型在2D图像生成方面表现突出，但3D领域缺乏可用的领先基础模型，导致基于自然语言描述生成高分辨率3D医学反事实图像的潜力未得到充分挖掘。

Method: 采用基于Simple Diffusion增强的先进3D滿散模型，结合增强条件控制来改善文本对齐和图像质量。这是首个应用于神经系统形态学数据的语言导向原生3D滿散模型。

Result: 在两个不同的神经系统MRI数据集上验证，成功模拟了多发硬化疾病的不同痕迹负荷和阿尔茫海默病的认知状态，生成了高质量图像同时保持了主体的信度。

Conclusion: 该框架为3D医学形态学领域的提示驱动的疾病进展分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor
diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high
accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and
accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major
source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we
classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using
Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We
also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer
learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model

Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5%
Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN,
UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices

real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for
timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset

Conclusion: FASL-Seg通过双流处理机制有效解决了不同分辨率特征捕获的平衡问题，在手术场景语义分割任务中表现出色，证明了针对不同特征分辨率采用差异化处理流的有效性。

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints,
heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL

outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and
research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters
cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen
domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder
with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize
MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method
enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects
dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides
robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,
reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical
studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging
powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while
addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited
annotations.

Conclusion: 要么承认这种LLM使用是合法的，要么需要对当前作者身份标准进行根本性修订

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and
medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some
circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether
and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is
distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including
paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and
ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper,
we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of
senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete
drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship
according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such
use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship
require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format

Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe
rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.
Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing
scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.
State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local
block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities
via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with
low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers
only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene
context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based
refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.
The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware
segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has
been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,
the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in
sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in
raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and
edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the
method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps
and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous
navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and
full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling
process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D
navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in
future planetary exploration missions.

Motivation: 为了解决传统DRL方法在长序列建模中的计算效率问题，以及提高在复杂环境中（如静态/动态障碍物、不平坦地形）的导航性能和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 使用MLP嵌入本体感知状态，CNN处理深度图像生成紧凑token；2) 堆叠Mamba层通过选择性扫描融合token，降低延迟和内存占用；3) 使用PPO端到端训练策略，结合地形外观随机化和障碍物密度课程学习。

Conclusion: LocoMamba框架通过选择性状态空间模型和高效的token融合机制，显著提升了视觉驱动DRL在复杂导航任务中的性能、泛化能力和训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D框架成功解决了3D空间模糊问题，能够生成高质量的3D感知机器人操作视频，为机器人操作数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at
(https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at
