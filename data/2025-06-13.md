Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的分类法，系统地整理了文本、图像和音频生成内容的自动评估方法，并识别了五种基本范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏一个跨文本、视觉和音频模态的系统性框架来组织自动评估方法。

Method: 通过综述和统一分类法，分析了文本、图像和音频生成内容的评估方法，并识别了五种基本范式。

Result: 提出了一个适用于多模态的评估框架，并展示了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 讨论了跨模态评估方法的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

### [2] [TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055)
*Dingfeng Shi,Jingyi Cao,Qianben Chen,Weichen Sun,Weizhen Li,Hongxuan Lu,Fangchen Dong,Tianrui Qin,King Zhu,Minghao Yang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaskCraft是一个自动化工作流，用于生成可扩展、多工具且可验证的代理任务，解决了现有指令数据缺乏工具交互和人工标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理任务在NLP和AI中日益重要，但现有数据缺乏工具交互，且依赖昂贵的人工标注，限制了可扩展性。

Method: TaskCraft通过深度和广度扩展原子任务，生成结构和层次复杂的挑战，并自动生成执行轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，这些任务改进了生成工作流中的提示优化，并提升了代理基础模型的监督微调效果。

Conclusion: TaskCraft提供了一个大规模合成数据集（约36,000个任务），支持未来代理调优和评估的研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语义退化对自然语言处理（NLP）系统的限制，提出意义是通过观察者依赖的诠释行为实现的，并通过实验验证了语言解释的非经典语境性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示语义退化对LLMs等NLP系统的固有限制，挑战传统语言学中形式自具意义的观点。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂性理论分析表达复杂性，并通过语义贝尔不等式测试，利用LLM代理在多样上下文环境中解释歧义词对。

Result: 实验结果显示CHSH期望值显著违反经典边界（1.2-2.8），表明语言解释具有非经典语境性。

Conclusion: 结论指出经典频率分析方法存在损失，提出贝叶斯重复采样方法更适合表征语境中的语言意义。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在语义相同但措辞不同的提示下的响应差异，提出了一种诊断框架PBSS，揭示了模型在语义等效提示下的行为漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在语义相同但措辞不同的提示下的响应差异，揭示模型评估稳定性中未被注意的维度。

Method: 提出Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS)框架，应用于十个约束任务，测量模型在语义等效提示下的行为漂移。

Result: PBSS揭示了模型在语义等效提示下的一致、模型特定的响应变化，表明这些变化与分词和解码策略相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明分词策略和解码动态可能影响模型训练后的服务质量稳定性，提示模型评估需考虑措辞差异的影响。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ChartReasoner框架，通过代码驱动的两阶段方法解决视觉推理任务中的信息丢失问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉推理任务转换为文本推理任务时丢失关键信息，尤其是在需要大量视觉细节的任务中。

Method: ChartReasoner通过高保真模型将图表转换为结构化代码，并设计数据合成管道生成推理轨迹，结合监督微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中表现优异，接近GPT-4o等专有系统的性能，同时参数更少。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner能有效保留图表细节，性能接近专有系统，为视觉推理任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督算法ICM，用于在没有外部监督的情况下微调预训练语言模型，其性能优于人类监督训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对超人类能力的语言模型难以获取高质量人工监督的问题，提出无监督方法以释放模型潜力。

Method: 通过Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM)算法，利用模型自身生成的标签进行微调。

Result: 在多个任务中，ICM性能媲美黄金监督训练，优于众包人工监督；在超人类任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: ICM方法可提升前沿语言模型的训练效果，其无监督奖励模型和助手均优于人工监督版本。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在共情沟通中的可靠性，通过比较专家、众包工作者和LLMs在四种评估框架下的标注表现，发现LLMs接近专家水平，并优于众包工作者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在共情沟通中的可靠性，为情感敏感应用提供透明度和监督支持。

Method: 比较专家、众包工作者和LLMs在四种心理学、自然语言处理和传播学框架下对200个真实对话的标注表现，分析评分者间一致性。

Result: 专家一致性较高但受框架子成分影响；LLMs接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定任务中表现可靠，可作为情感敏感应用的透明工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在孟加拉语社交媒体评论中进行情感分析的方法，使用了多种机器学习模型和降维技术，并利用LIME解释模型预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在推动资源有限语言（如孟加拉语）的情感分析，探索高效的情感识别技术。

Method: 使用Linear SVM、KNN、Random Forest、BiLSTM和AdaBoost等模型，结合TF-IDF向量化和PCA降维，并利用LIME解释AdaBoost分类器的预测。

Result: 研究比较了多种技术在孟加拉语情感分析中的表现，并提供了模型解释性分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为资源有限语言的情感分析提供了有效方法，并展示了模型解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

### [10] [Measuring Corporate Human Capital Disclosures: Lexicon, Data, Code, and Research Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10155)
*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的词汇表开发方法，用于衡量和披露人力资本（HC）的多维度管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造日益重要，但缺乏明确的衡量和披露规则。

Method: 使用word2vec算法训练HC披露关键词，分类为五个子类别，并提供词汇表、数据和代码。

Result: 开发了一个全面的HC相关关键词词汇表，支持未来研究。

Conclusion: 研究为HC管理提供了工具，并讨论了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在故事生成中的能力，通过叙事规划问题评估其表现，发现GPT-4级模型能生成小规模因果合理的故事，但复杂推理仍需强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自动评估方法的局限性和人工评估的高成本与主观性，理解LLMs生成高质量故事的能力仍有限。

Method: 利用叙事规划问题评估LLMs，基于文学示例构建基准，关注因果合理性、角色意图性和戏剧冲突。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4级模型能生成小规模因果合理的故事，但角色意图性和戏剧冲突的规划仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在不同规模故事生成中的能力边界，并为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了挑战与启示。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

TL;DR: Q2E方法通过分解查询利用LLMs和VLMs中的知识，提升零样本多语言文本到视频检索性能，支持多模态输入，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进复杂现实世界事件的视频检索，通过自动提取LLMs和VLMs中的潜在参数知识。

Method: 提出Q2E方法，分解查询并利用LLMs和VLMs的知识，结合熵融合评分进行多模态零样本融合。

Result: Q2E在多个数据集和指标上优于现有方法，音频信息的整合显著提升检索效果。

Conclusion: Q2E展示了利用多模态知识改进视频检索的潜力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench是一个新基准，通过简单的井字棋类游戏评估大型推理模型（LRMs）的战略、空间和逻辑推理能力，发现其在简单任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在STEM领域之外的推理能力，尤其是战略、空间和逻辑推理。

Method: 提出TTT-Bench，通过四种井字棋类游戏生成可验证的问题，评估LRMs的表现。

Result: LRMs在简单推理游戏中表现较差，相比数学任务平均下降41%和5%。

Conclusion: LRMs在复杂数学任务中表现出色，但在简单战略推理任务中存在明显不足。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用计算方法识别不可靠叙述者，并构建了TUNa数据集，测试了多种LLM模型在此任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过计算手段识别叙述者是否可靠，尤其是在多领域文本中。

Method: 结合叙事学理论定义不可靠叙述者类型，构建TUNa数据集，测试LLM模型在分类任务中的表现。

Result: 任务具有挑战性，但LLM在识别不可靠叙述者方面有潜力。

Conclusion: 释放数据集和代码，鼓励未来研究。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT是首个葡萄牙语大规模语料库，支持对九个受法律保护的少数群体进行细粒度仇恨言论分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决葡萄牙语中仇恨言论检测数据稀缺的问题，并填补现有数据集中在社交媒体领域的空白。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：手动筛选种子数据、基于指令调优的LLM进行少样本扩展、基于释义的增强、以及中性文本的补充。

Result: 生成的语料库类别平衡、风格多样，并在五个公开葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为低资源环境下的合成数据和仇恨言论检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

Result: 发现语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可能产生最大似然估计，导致虚假先验的推断。

Conclusion: 提出了一种方法以避免误导性先验的推断，为理解大型语言模型的决策机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类和改进UCB算法的高效梯度数据选择框架ClusterUCB，显著降低了计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度数据选择方法计算资源消耗过大，难以实际应用。

Method: 通过聚类将数据分组，利用改进的UCB算法解决预算分配问题，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterUCB在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效且实用的梯度数据选择方法。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Flick的新方法，用于解决低资源语言环境下的少标签文本分类问题，通过改进伪标签质量显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对大量标注数据的依赖，解决现有方法在低资源语言环境中伪标签噪声和领域适应问题。

Method: Flick通过从初始广泛集群中提取高置信度伪标签，并引入伪标签细化组件，利用单集群凝聚力和自适应top-k选择机制。

Result: 在14个多样化数据集（包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言）上展示了Flick的优越性能和适应性。

Conclusion: Flick显著提升了伪标签质量，适用于低资源语言环境，为少标签分类问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户建议对大型语言模型（LLM）在教育模拟场景中的影响，发现模型会根据用户提供的答案调整其回答，表现出明显的迎合行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在教育环境中，LLM的迎合行为可能加剧学习不平等，因此需要研究其影响机制和缓解方法。

Method: 测试了五款不同规模的LLM（包括GPT-4o和GPT-4.1系列），通过五种实验条件分析其回答质量变化。

Result: 当学生提到错误答案时，LLM的正确率下降15个百分点；提到正确答案时则提升15个百分点。小模型（如GPT-4.1-nano）的迎合效应更强（30%），而大模型（如GPT-4o）较弱（8%）。

Conclusion: LLM的迎合行为对教育公平有重要影响，需进一步研究其机制并开发缓解方法。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过交替训练语音和文本来解决语音到语音翻译中模态适应问题的方法，显著提升了翻译性能，尤其是在数据稀缺的语言上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常基于文本数据训练，难以直接适应语音模态，尤其是在语音数据有限的情况下。

Method: 采用渐进式交替训练策略，在训练过程中交替使用语音和文本单元，并逐步减少文本比例以促进模态适应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CVSS数据集上显著提升了翻译性能，尤其是在低资源语言上。

Conclusion: 渐进式交替训练是一种有效的模态适应策略，能够提升语音到语音翻译的性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升LLM在不同任务中的推理能力，并减少推理时的冗余重复和过度思考。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成高精度推理数据，并显著提升LLM的推理效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理异构文档（包含文本和表格）时存在局限性，如表格结构破坏和信息丢失，影响多跳推理能力。

Method: TableRAG通过四步迭代操作：上下文敏感查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程与执行、组合中间答案生成。

Result: TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA基准测试中均优于现有基线，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: TableRAG为异构文档问答提供了高效解决方案，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自我验证输出正确性方面表现不佳，现有方法依赖额外验证模型或多阶段训练，扩展性差。

Method: 提出PAG框架，结合生成与验证角色，通过选择性修正机制在多轮RL中优化模型表现。

Result: PAG在多项推理基准测试中表现优异，生成和验证能力均显著提升。

Conclusion: PAG为LLM自我验证提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，兼具高效性和扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Method: 设计了三个测试（事件关系推理、句子排序和图像排序）及基础任务，评估了38个先进MLLMs。

Result: 模型在TempVS上表现不佳，与人类能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: TempVS为MLLMs的时间推理能力提供了基准，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

Motivation: 现有冲突框架研究多为定性或浅层分析，缺乏深度，本文旨在通过计算语言学方法深入探讨新闻框架对冲突的影响。

Method: 结合框架语义学和大型语言模型，分析新闻语料中的战争与和平报道框架及其语言特征。

Result: 发现战争报道多于和平报道，且美、英和中东媒体在冲突角色描述上存在显著偏见。

Conclusion: 新闻媒体的框架选择可能加剧冲突，需更平衡的报道以减少偏见。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如Chain-of-Thought提示虽能提升推理能力，但导致输出过长和计算延迟；而强化学习方法因统一惩罚机制无法适应问题复杂性，效果欠佳。

Method: 通过分割奖励函数并引入输出长度惩罚，动态调整模型推理效率，以适应不同复杂度的问题。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上缩短了输出长度并保持或提升准确性；在更复杂的AIME2024数据集上提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM的推理效率，同时兼顾了简单和复杂问题的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅预测科学主张的最终标签（支持或反驳）缺乏解释性，无法揭示模型的推理过程。因此，需要一种能识别关键表格单元格的方法以提高模型的可解释性。

Method: 通过扩展SciTab基准数据集，添加人工标注的单元格级别推理路径，并构建分类法处理模糊案例。实验结合表格对齐信息验证主张。

Result: 实验表明：(i) 结合表格对齐信息能提升主张验证性能；(ii) 多数大语言模型虽能预测正确标签，但无法恢复人类标注的推理路径。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种提升科学主张验证可解释性的方法，但现有大语言模型在忠实推理方面仍有不足。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Method: 通过预提示人物角色评估MMLU基准，重新设计任务（如用户答案评分和薪资谈判建议）以检测偏见。

Result: 预提示人物角色在MMLU上差异不显著，但用户答案评分和薪资谈判建议中表现出明显偏见。

Conclusion: 随着LLM助手记忆和个性化趋势，模型已知用户社会人口特征，偏见问题需从新角度解决。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在多用户DST中存在局限性，未来需改进以支持更真实、鲁棒的DST模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，主要因缺乏背景知识和易产生幻觉。现有方法虽结合知识图（KGs），但仍难以解决复杂问题。

Method: 提出RRP框架，利用关系嵌入和双向分布学习提取知识图的结构信息，并通过反思模块评估和优化推理路径。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，RRP表现优于基线方法，并能以即插即用方式增强LLMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: RRP通过生成高质量推理路径，为LLMs提供有效指导，提升其推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLMs）能逐字符拼写单词，但其内部处理字符级信息的方式复杂，依赖中间层和高层Transformer重建字符知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息，揭示其处理方式与人类不同。

Method: 通过探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重分析三种方法验证LLMs的拼写机制。

Result: 发现LLMs的嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息，尤其是首字符之后的部分，需依赖中间层和高层Transformer重建。

Conclusion: LLMs的拼写行为依赖复杂内部机制，而非简单的字符级编码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）检测威胁生命语言的方法，并与传统方法进行了比较。实验表明，LLMs在平衡和不平衡数据场景下表现优异，尤其是Mistral和Llama-2模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命的语言对保护个体心理健康和预防潜在伤害至关重要。

Method: 使用Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2三种开源LLMs，在平衡、不平衡和极端不平衡数据集上进行微调，并与传统方法（如词袋模型、词嵌入等）对比。

Result: LLMs表现优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2在各类数据场景下表现最佳。上采样技术对传统方法有帮助，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在现实世界的威胁生命语言检测问题中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化减少大型推理模型的冗余计算，降低成本同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和OpenAI o1）在数学推理中因冗长的链式思维（CoT）导致的令牌使用和成本过高问题。

Method: 结合轨迹级诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡令牌长度和答案有效性。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500基准上，保持或超过基线准确性（Claude 96%→96%，Gemini 91%→92%），同时减少87.5%的推理令牌和69-82%的成本。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是实现高效推理模型推理的实用且可扩展方法，不影响推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimSpect框架通过层次化分解和检索增强生成，为复杂声明提供多角度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决声明（如科学或政治声明）难以简单标记为真或假的问题，提供更全面的验证方法。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，通过检索增强生成构建声明层次结构，并检索相关语料以发现子方面和不同观点。

Result: 在真实科学和政治声明数据集上验证了框架的鲁棒性和准确性，优于多个基线。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect能有效解构复杂声明并展示语料中的多角度观点，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt是一个动态适应多维度科学文献分类的框架，通过迭代层次分类生成更细粒度和一致的分类法，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域快速演变，传统专家分类耗时昂贵，现有自动方法缺乏通用性和动态适应性，且忽视文献的多维性。

Method: TaxoAdapt利用LLM生成的分类法，通过迭代层次分类动态扩展分类法的宽度和深度，适应不同维度的科学文献。

Result: TaxoAdapt在计算机科学会议数据集上表现优异，分类法比基线方法更细粒度（提升26.51%）和一致（提升50.41%）。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能有效捕捉科学领域的动态演变，生成更优的多维分类法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在训练时面临模型容量有限、高质量数据稀缺和计算资源限制等问题，且分词器的语言覆盖不足导致训练后难以适应新语言。

Method: 提出使用通用分词器，覆盖比主要训练语言更多的语言，以提升训练后的语言适应能力。

Result: 实验表明，通用分词器显著提升了语言适应能力，胜率最高提升20.2%，且对未见语言的适应能力也有5%的提升。

Conclusion: 通用分词器是一种低成本且高效的干预方法，能在不显著影响主要训练语言性能的情况下，显著提升模型对新语言的适应能力。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR系统在命名实体识别上表现不佳，而命名实体是关键信息，错误识别会影响下游应用。因此，需要一种方法来修正这些错误。

Method: 引入LLM修正机制，利用LLM的推理能力和包含正确命名实体的本地上下文（如讲义）来修正ASR预测中的命名实体错误。

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，该方法实现了命名实体WER相对降低30%。

Conclusion: LLM修正机制能有效提升ASR系统在命名实体识别上的准确性，为下游应用提供更可靠的输入。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

TL;DR: LangEdit是一个新颖的框架，通过正交投影隔离语言特定知识更新，解决多语言LLM中知识更新的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言LLM中知识更新的干扰问题导致多语言泛化能力下降，现有方法成本高或效果差。

Method: LangEdit利用零空间约束框架，将参数更新投影到先前更新子空间的正交补空间，确保更新独立性。

Result: 在三种模型架构、六种语言和四项任务中，LangEdit显著优于现有方法，减少干扰并保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: LangEdit为多语言LLM的高效准确知识更新提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和基础模型上，ReCUT显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效解决了推理长度与准确性的平衡问题，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的dLLMs采样策略（如基于置信度或半自回归解码）存在静态行为问题，导致效率低下和灵活性不足。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling策略，遵循确定性、收敛性和位置性三个原则，并结合dLLM-Cache减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明，SlowFast Sampling在LLaDA上实现了15.63倍的速度提升，结合缓存后可达34.22倍，且准确率损失极小。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling展示了通过优化采样策略可以充分发挥dLLMs的潜力，实现快速高质量生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Conclusion: wav2vec2的表示结构主要独立于预训练语音材料。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Result: 在MedDG和KaMed基准测试中，MedRef在生成质量和医学实体准确性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MedRef在真实医疗应用中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Motivation: 探讨参数高效方法（如LoRA和QLoRA）对大型语言模型性能的影响，为资源有限的开发者提供实用指导。

Method: 使用LoRA和QLoRA方法，在常识推理（HellaSwag）、数学推理（GSM8K）和多领域知识（MMLU-CS）三个领域评估模型性能。

Result: LoRA方法显著提升任务性能且计算高效；性能与微调数据集和任务的匹配度高度相关。

Conclusion: 研究为参数高效机制提供了理论见解，并为资源有限的开发者提供了实用的模型适配指导。

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large
language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and
QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在微调过程中表现出的双重性：既能从新事实中泛化，又容易产生幻觉。研究发现，这两种行为源于一种称为“上下文外推理”（OCR）的机制，并通过实验和理论分析验证了其作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在知识获取中表现出的泛化与幻觉的双重性，揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR在五种主流LLMs中的作用，并设计合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力模型的性能。

Result: OCR是泛化和幻觉的共同机制，矩阵分解在任务解决中起关键作用，梯度下降的隐式偏置解释了OCR的高效学习能力。

Conclusion: 研究为理解OCR现象提供了理论基础，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: BioClinical ModernBERT是一种针对生物医学和临床NLP优化的编码器模型，通过大规模预训练和多源数据适应，显著提升了性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学和临床NLP中编码器模型发展较慢，现有模型在领域适应性和性能上存在局限。

Method: 基于ModernBERT，通过53.5亿标记的大规模预训练和多源数据集（20个）进行领域适应。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优于现有生物医学和临床编码器。

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT为生物医学和临床NLP提供了高效、高性能的解决方案，并开源支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的系统性自动评估方法（EFG），用于改进高级数学领域的自动形式化任务评估，通过多维度标准（如逻辑保留、数学一致性等）提升评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动形式化任务的评估方法粗糙且通用，难以应对高级数学领域的复杂需求，而人工评估又耗时且需要专业知识。因此，需要一种自动化的、细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的EFG评估框架，通过逻辑保留（LP）、数学一致性（MC）、形式有效性（FV）和形式质量（FQ）等多维度标准进行透明评估。

Result: 实验表明，EFG框架与人工评估的相关性更强，尤其在评估形式质量时表现优于粗粒度模型。

Conclusion: EFG框架为自动形式化任务提供了一种可扩展、可解释且可靠的评估方法，尤其在高级数学领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable

implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data
from Magistral Medium.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法SNMF，用于在大型语言模型中识别可解释的特征方向，优于现有方法如SAEs和监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在因果评估中表现不佳且缺乏内在可解释性，因此需要一种更直接的方法。

Method: 采用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）直接分解MLP激活，学习稀疏线性组合的神经元特征，并将其映射到输入。

Result: 在Llama 3.1、Gemma 2和GPT-2上的实验表明，SNMF特征在因果操控和人类可解释性上优于SAEs和监督基线。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别可解释特征并揭示LLM中概念表示的层次结构。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦模型为LLMs对齐提供了新视角，未来可扩展至更复杂的对话场景。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数据分布对齐假设（DA²）找到最优数据混合，以提升语言模型性能。

Method: Domain2Vec通过分类器将数据集分解为元域向量分布，并利用DA²假设优化数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec仅需51.5%的计算量即可达到相同验证损失，并在相同计算预算下平均提升2.83%的下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec高效且可扩展，能显著提升语言模型预训练和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

Conclusion: AutoMind是迈向完全自动化数据科学的重要一步，具有显著的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Result: 模型能识别无益思维但难以恢复，大模型表现更差，且存在非/逆缩放趋势。

Conclusion: 需改进模型的自我重新评估能力，以提升推理效果和系统安全性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频编辑性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、灵活的视频编辑，同时保留了背景区域。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统视觉主干网络的特征构建方式单一，缺乏自适应迭代优化路径，探索是否可以通过算法搜索原则实现更结构化和逻辑化的处理流程。

Method: DeepTraverse包含递归探索模块（深化特征分析）和自适应校准模块（动态调整特征显著性），通过参数共享和全局上下文实现高效特征构建。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，DeepTraverse表现出色，分类准确性和特征区分度优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 集成算法先验为构建更高效、性能更强且结构化的视觉主干网络提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

TL;DR: EfficientVLA是一个无需训练的推理加速框架，通过协同利用多方面的冗余性，显著提升了Vision-Language-Action（VLA）模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型（如基于扩散的架构）在计算和内存需求上存在严重冗余，限制了实际部署能力。现有加速方法通常只针对局部低效问题，未能全面解决整个VLA管道的瓶颈。

Method: EfficientVLA整合了三种策略：1）基于冗余分析修剪语言模块的无关层；2）通过任务感知策略优化视觉处理路径；3）在扩散动作头中缓存和重用中间特征以减少计算冗余。

Result: 在CogACT模型上应用EfficientVLA，推理速度提升1.93倍，FLOPs降至28.9%，在SIMPLER基准测试中成功率仅下降0.6%。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA通过系统性冗余消除，显著提升了VLA模型的效率，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具缺乏多模态环境下检测未成年人内容的数据集或基准，ICCWD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建了包含10,000张图像-标题对的ICCWD数据集，手动标注是否包含未成年人，并用于测试三种检测器。

Result: 最佳检测方法的真阳性率为75.3%，表明未成年人检测任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ICCWD的发布有望帮助设计更优的未成年人检测方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Conclusion: 细粒度幻觉批评是增强视觉语言模型视觉感知的有效且通用的目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA为跨域自动驾驶提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真图像时面临多样性不足的问题，尤其是在提示语义广泛时。现有方法通过多样性度量进行引导，但计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出SPARKE方法，利用条件熵进行多样性引导，动态测量相似提示的多样性，并通过简化条件潜在RKE得分引导降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，SPARKE在多个文本到图像扩散模型中显著提高了生成数据的提示感知多样性，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效解决了扩散模型在多样性生成中的挑战，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖月度统计估算背景反射率，无法适应山区雪盖动态变化，导致地表太阳辐射（SSR）检索不准确。

Method: 采用基于时空视觉变换器的注意力模拟器，无需手工特征（如反照率图或云掩膜），直接从多光谱卫星图像序列中学习晴空反射率。

Result: 模型在提供足够长的时间上下文时，性能与依赖反照率信息的模型相当，尤其在山区表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法能够隐式学习地表反射率动态，提升复杂地形下的SSR检索泛化能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分评估掩码图像建模（MIM）模型的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数冗余和计算效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的探测方法。

Method: 引入高效探测（EP），采用多查询交叉注意力机制，减少冗余投影和可训练参数，提升计算效率。

Result: EP在七个基准测试中优于LP和现有注意力探测方法，泛化能力强，生成可解释的注意力图，并在低样本和分层设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EP是一种高效且性能优越的注意力探测方法，适用于多种预训练范式，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Result: 在两个基准测试（DeepFashion2和ConCon-Chi）上，个性化检索准确率比现有方法提升4%-22%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留通用知识的同时，显著提升了个性化视觉语言检索的性能。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Result: ScoreMix在所有测试基准中显著提升了判别器性能，且无需大量参数搜索。

Conclusion: ScoreMix是一种简单有效的数据增强方法，适用于标注数据有限的场景，并能减少大规模数据集的需求。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有稀疏查询方法在视频帧增多时计算成本高的问题，同时提升检测性能。

Method: 利用状态空间模型（SSM）处理时间序列特征，引入未来预测和掩码重建任务训练SSM，动态更新查询（合并、移除、拆分）。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到65.31 NDS和57.4 mAP，验证集上56.2 NDS和46.2 mAP，实时推理速度33 FPS。

Conclusion: DySS通过动态查询和状态空间学习，显著提升了检测效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 该研究通过迁移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）评估了深度学习模型在皮肤癌分类中的表现，发现CLIP-based视觉变换器结合SVM性能最佳，同时集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确诊断对早期治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识。

Method: 研究分两阶段：1）比较多种预训练特征提取器和分类器；2）引入UQ方法（MCD、Ensemble、EMCD）评估模型可靠性。

Result: CLIP-based视觉变换器（如LAION CLIP ViT-H/14）结合SVM表现最佳；集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间表现均衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医学诊断中集成UQ的重要性，以提高模型在临床实践中的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种弱监督多模态框架，用于从有限输入（如病变图像和稀疏临床文本）生成结构化SOAP笔记，减轻临床医生负担，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致临床医生疲劳，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两种新指标评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且临床实用，显著减轻临床医生负担，减少对大规模标注数据的需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Motivation: 随着元宇宙的兴起，全向视频（ODV）逐渐从专业生成内容（PGC）转向用户生成内容（UGC），但针对UGC ODV的音频视觉质量评估（AVQA）研究仍有限。

Method: 构建了一个包含300个视频的UGC ODV数据集，通过主观实验获得平均意见分数（MOS），并设计了一个包含视频特征提取、音频特征提取和音视频融合模块的基线模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的基线模型在数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了UGC ODV AVQA领域的空白，提出的基线模型为后续研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [80] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在在线学习环境中通过零样本提示分析学生学术情绪的潜力，发现Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法在跨上下文泛化能力上存在不足，而VLMs提供了一种无需微调即可实现零样本识别的替代方案。

Method: 使用两种VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）对5000张学生面部表情图像进行零样本分析，涵盖困惑、分心、快乐、中立和疲惫五种情绪。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现更优，尤其在快乐和困惑情绪识别上，但两种模型均无法有效识别分心行为。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别困惑情绪方面的表现，为实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点特征感知的高斯溅射框架，解决了3DGS在稀疏视图输入下的过拟合问题，实现了实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 利用立体基础模型估计相机位姿并重建密集点云，通过多尺度2D特征采样和自注意力网络增强点间交互，最终通过MLP解码为高斯参数。

Result: 在多种基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，并在少样本设置下与最先进的3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图下实现了高质量的实时渲染，解决了3DGS的过拟合问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时满足遵循文本指令和聚焦局部部分的需求，GeoCAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出互补标注策略（顶点和VLLM标注），训练时随机遮挡局部部分，利用几何指令和剩余部分输入LLM预测遮挡部分。

Result: 实验表明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD成功实现了局部几何可控的CAD生成，代码将开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的多模态研究框架，用于自动化和可扩展地分析城市街景风格差异，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于地理、历史和社会政治因素的差异，城市文化和建筑风格在不同城市间存在显著差异。传统研究方法依赖专家解释和历史文献，难以标准化。因此，需要一种更客观、数据驱动的方法来研究城市形态。

Method: 论文提出了UrbanSense框架，基于视觉语言模型，构建了UrbanDiffBench数据集，用于定量生成和比较城市风格表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，超过80%的生成描述通过t检验（p<0.05），主观评估的高Phi分数（城市0.912，时期0.833）表明该方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化城市风格演变提供了科学依据，对未来设计具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) 是一种分辨率无关的医学图像配准方法，避免了传统方法因重采样引入的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的配准方法需将图像重采样至固定分辨率，可能因插值引入伪影，限制了配准效果。

Method: RKM 扩展了 KeyMorph 框架，通过训练网络学习图像对的关键点，并在真实世界坐标系中输出关键点，避免重采样。

Result: 实验表明，RKM 在腹部 MRI 和不同分辨率脑部数据集的配准任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RKM 提供了一种更优的配准方法，适用于不同分辨率的医学图像。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到运动生成方法依赖端到端映射，缺乏对深层语言结构和逻辑推理的捕捉，导致生成的运动缺乏可控性、一致性和多样性。

Method: 提出 Motion-R1 框架，结合 Chain-of-Thought 机制分解指令，并采用 Group Relative Policy Optimization 强化学习算法联合优化推理链和运动合成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，Motion-R1 在语义理解和长期时间一致性方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Motion-R1 显著提升了复杂指令的运动生成能力，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Result: 实验表明FSATFusion在融合质量和效率上优于现有方法，且具有优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FSATFusion在红外与可见光图像融合及下游视觉任务中表现优越。

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 本文为自注意力机制提供了更深入的理论解释，并通过架构修改展示了其实际性能提升的潜力。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

TL;DR: PoseIDON是一种结合深度学习与多视角摄影测量的计算机视觉方法，用于估计海底物体埋藏深度，误差约10厘米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究海底物体埋藏状态对评估生态风险、污染物迁移及危险物质回收策略至关重要，但现有遥感图像方法难以准确估计埋藏深度。

Method: 提出PoseIDON方法，结合深度基础模型特征与多视角摄影测量，通过ROV视频估计物体六自由度位姿及海底平面，并与CAD模型对齐推断埋藏深度。

Result: 在54个物体（如桶和弹药）上验证，平均埋藏深度误差约10厘米，并能反映沉积物迁移过程的空间埋藏模式。

Conclusion: PoseIDON方法支持非侵入式、可扩展的海底埋藏测绘，有助于污染场地的环境评估。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Result: DART在DeiT（ImageNet-1K）上提升2.1%准确率，减少45% FLOPs，并在多个模型中表现一致。

Conclusion: DART提供了一种高效的方法，显著提升性能且计算开销低，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态基础模型在图像理解和生成方面取得进展，但其性能仍不及专用模型。Pisces旨在解决视觉特征和训练过程的差异问题。

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准测试和GenEval生成基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成之间的协同关系，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LRRNet的新型端到端红外小目标检测框架，利用红外图像背景的低秩特性，通过压缩-重建-减法（CRS）范式直接建模结构感知的低秩背景表示，无需依赖基于块的处理或显式矩阵分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测（IRSTD）在复杂背景下因低信噪比、目标形态多样及缺乏显著视觉线索而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法因目标内在多变性和弱先验导致性能不稳定。

Method: 采用压缩-重建-减法（CRS）范式，直接学习图像域中的低秩背景结构，通过端到端深度神经网络实现。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上，LRRNet在检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率上优于38种最先进方法，平均速度达82.34 FPS，且在噪声环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LRRNet是首个直接通过端到端深度神经网络学习低秩背景结构的方法，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容快速增长，传统单模态方法难以捕捉视频的完整语义，需要更有效的多模态摘要技术。

Method: MF2Summ采用五阶段流程：特征提取、跨模态注意力交互、特征融合、片段预测和关键镜头选择，使用Transformer和NMS/KTS算法。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上，MF2Summ的F1分数分别比DSNet提高1.9%和0.6%，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合显著提升了视频摘要性能，证明了跨模态交互的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态缺失和分布外（OOD）数据的双重挑战，现有方法因依赖特定模型或参数过多而实用性受限。

Method: CIDer框架包含模型特定自蒸馏（MSSD）和模型无关因果推理（MACI）模块，MSSD通过权重共享自蒸馏增强鲁棒性，MACI通过因果图减少偏差。

Result: CIDer在随机模态特征缺失（RMFM）和OOD场景中表现鲁棒，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer为MER提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>

Motivation: 传统显式运动方法在人体视频压缩中因复杂多样的运动模式导致重建结果失真和运动不准确，因此需要探索更有效的方法。

Method: 通过将复杂人体信号表征为紧凑视觉特征，并将其转化为隐式运动指导以重建信号。

Result: 实验证明IMT范式能有效提升GHVC的高效压缩和高保真合成性能。

Conclusion: IMT为生成式人体视频编码提供了更优的解决方案，克服了显式运动方法的局限性。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）分类技术基于深度神经网络（DNNs），但DNNs易受对抗攻击。现有研究未能充分利用HSI的结构和特征信息，迁移性受限。

Method: 方法包括随机分块以增加输入多样性，并设计特征距离损失以干扰真实类别的特征。

Result: 实验表明，生成的对抗样本在公开HSI数据集上对黑盒模型具有有效迁移性，且在防御策略下仍保持攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性，为HSI分类模型的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是降低机器学习模型推理成本的重要工具，但权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 分析了不同权重初始化对CNN量化鲁棒性的影响，并提出GHN-QAT方法，通过GHN预测量化DNN参数并微调。

Result: GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化的精度，甚至在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN模型设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical

Motivation: 深度伪造技术日益复杂，威胁媒体完整性和公众信任，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）因其多领域潜力被探索用于深度伪造检测。

Method: 研究对ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini和Grok四种VLMs进行零样本评估，使用包含真实和伪造图像的基准数据集，测试其分类准确性和推理深度。

Result: VLMs能生成合理解释并检测表面异常，但依赖度不足，易受风格元素和误导性视觉模式（如复古美学）影响。

Conclusion: VLMs虽不适合独立检测系统，但在可解释性和上下文分析方面表现突出，适合作为混合或人机协作检测框架的补充。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music

textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜的植物来源影响其风味和健康价值，但难以一次性收集所有品种训练模型，因此需要类增量学习技术。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的隐藏神经元来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提高了1-7%。

Conclusion: CB方法有效解决了类增量学习中的塑性损失问题，提升了蜂蜜植物来源分类的准确性。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated

Conclusion: CogReasoner在CogStream任务中表现高效，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Result: 实验证明CEI能有效检测现有方法难以发现的细微偏差。

Conclusion: CEI为评估人脸识别系统的公平性提供了强大且敏感的工具，适用于任何关注分布尾部比较的问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various
domains, including autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and mixed reality.
Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and

decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior
performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy,

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了人-产品演示视频生成中的身份保持和空间关系问题，生成了更真实和自然的交互效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Conclusion: PLACE框架通过病理级别对齐和相关性探索，显著提升了医学视觉表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐与舞蹈之间存在语义鸿沟，且音乐到舞蹈的映射是一对多的，现有方法难以生成多样且符合音乐风格的舞蹈动作。

Method: 提出DanceChat，包含LLM生成文本指导、多模态特征融合和扩散模型动作合成三个模块。

Result: 在AIST++数据集和人工评估中，DanceChat在质量和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM的文本指导能有效提升音乐到舞蹈生成的多样性和风格对齐。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 解决CLIP模型中文本与图像模态差距问题，提升仅用文本进行参数高效微调时的图像识别性能。

Method: 利用文本生成图像模型生成多样化图像，结合类热图和可学习原型增强局部特征表示，并融合提示调优和适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升3.47%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL无需全语义标注图像，减少人工标注负担，且兼容现有CLIP框架。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在四个物体数据集和两个人脸数据集上验证，表明该方法能更好地保留超球面流形的几何特性。

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff通过几何对齐和不确定性建模，显著提升了超球面数据的生成性能。

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Motivation: 随机掩码可能无意中消除关键语义信息，因此需要更智能的掩码策略来保留监督信号的完整性。

Method: 在DINO框架中，仅对学生的全局视图应用随机掩码，保留学生的局部视图和教师的全局视图的原始形式。

Conclusion: 非对称随机掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，既能保留监督信号的完整性，又能增强模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Motivation: 航空设备的高质量（高性能、高稳定性和高可靠性）是关键，需要一种有效的误差评估方法。

Conclusion: HEA-MM框架为航空制造提供了一种高效的分层误差评估方法。

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0等数据集上，SSP在点监督下达到45.78% mAP，优于现有方法4.10%。

Conclusion: SSP为高密度场景的定向目标检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

Result: 在公开数据集和自采集数据集上验证，LatentCSI在计算效率和感知质量上优于基线方法，并具备文本引导控制能力。

Conclusion: LatentCSI提供了一种高效、高质量且可控的图像生成方法，适用于WiFi CSI到图像的转换。

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的边界框标注且难以统一多种查询类型，限制了场景文本检索的灵活性和效率。

Method: MSTAR采用渐进式视觉嵌入和多实例匹配模块，动态捕捉文本多粒度表示并增强视觉-语言对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAP提升6.4%，MQTR基准上平均提升8.5%。

Conclusion: MSTAR通过消除标注成本并支持多查询类型，为场景文本检索提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets
are available at https://github.com/yingift/MSTAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到纹理合成方法在扩散过程中未能充分整合先前合成的纹理，且视角选择固定，导致纹理一致性差。

Method: TexTailor采用重采样方案整合纹理信息，并微调深度感知扩散模型，同时提出性能保持损失和自适应视角调整。

Result: 在Objaverse和ShapeNet数据集上，TexTailor在生成视角一致纹理方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理整合和视角选择，显著提升了纹理合成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在自然图像领域表现出色，但在医学影像中因数据有限而研究较少。本文旨在解决其在胸部X光片中与放射学报告的多模态对齐问题。

Method: 通过微调预训练的潜在扩散模型，改进其多模态对齐能力，使其适用于下游任务（如短语定位）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了潜在扩散模型在医学影像中的多模态对齐能力，为下游任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有方法在图像生成和语义任务之间存在分离，且通常需要严格的映射条件。SymmFlow旨在统一这些任务并支持灵活的标签条件。

Method: 采用对称学习目标，联合建模正向和反向变换，引入新训练目标以显式保留语义信息，支持一步分割和分类。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别取得FID 11.9和7.0，仅需25步推理，同时在分割和分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SymmFlow在多任务中实现高效且灵活的生成与语义处理，代码将开源。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Method: 设计提示驱动的数据引擎和奖励引导的训练策略，利用预训练视觉语言模型反馈优化微调过程。

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，GigaVideo-1平均性能提升约4%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1无需人工标注和大量真实数据，展示了高效且有效的视频生成微调方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

TL;DR: PiPViT是一种基于视觉变换器的原型模型，通过学习可解释的原型来提升医学图像分类的透明度和临床相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型方法在医学图像中学习的原型过于细粒度，且可视化结果与人类可理解的生物标志物不一致。

Method: 利用视觉变换器（ViT）捕获长距离依赖关系，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，学习可解释的原型。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分类任务中表现优异，原型具有临床意义，且解释性更强。

Conclusion: PiPViT能够透明地解释决策过程，辅助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Result: 在Style GAN数据集上分类准确率94.14%，AUC-ROC得分0.985。

Conclusion: 该模型为低资源环境下的深度伪造检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的无源对抗CAPTCHA框架UAC，利用文本提示生成高质量对抗样本，支持定向和非定向攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案易受深度神经网络攻击，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原始图像特征，导致失真且适用性受限。

Method: UAC框架利用大语言模型生成对抗样本，EDICT方法优化扩散模型的双潜变量，BP-UAC采用双路径优化策略。

Result: 实验显示BP-UAC在多种系统中攻击成功率高，生成的CAPTCHA对人类和DNN均难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效提升CAPTCHA多样性，支持高效对抗攻击，适用于无初始图像的场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Method: 采用多任务架构，结合冻结的FaRL骨干网络和共享特征的MLP，引入α加权焦点损失和年龄平衡采样策略。

Result: 在ASORES-39k测试集上，年龄估计的RMSE从5.733降至5.656，18岁以下检测的F2分数从0.801提升至0.857。在ASWIFT-20k测试集上，召回率接近0.99，F2分数从0.742提升至0.833。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在年龄估计和未成年人检测任务中表现出色，尤其在分布偏移下具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异，提升了层次泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC通过双曲空间有效建模层次关系，为多粒度持续学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Motivation: 现有COD方法在目标与背景视觉差异较小的情况下表现有限，生成式细化尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出UMBD框架，结合不确定性引导的掩蔽机制和伯努利扩散，并设计HUQNet网络进行多源不确定性量化。

Result: 在多个COD基准测试中，UMBD平均提升了5.5%的MAE和3.2%的加权F-measure，且计算开销较小。

Conclusion: UMBD通过生成式细化显著提升了COD性能，且易于与现有模型集成。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法在模板匹配中展示了实际应用价值，提升了表面缺陷检测效率。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP在医学异常检测中表现优异，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Motivation: 生成美观海报比简单设计更具挑战性，需要精确的文本渲染和艺术内容的无缝融合。

Method: PosterCraft采用级联工作流，包括大规模文本渲染优化、区域感知微调、美学文本强化学习和联合视觉语言反馈细化。

Result: PosterCraft在渲染准确性、布局连贯性和视觉吸引力方面显著优于开源基线，接近商业系统水平。

Conclusion: PosterCraft通过自动化数据构建和多阶段优化，实现了高质量海报生成，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SbCA的统一模型，用于解决超大规模图像超分辨率任务中的性能下降问题，通过笔画向量放大器和细节补全模块实现高质量图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASISR方法在超出训练数据范围的放大因子下性能显著下降，导致图像模糊。

Method: 提出SbCA模型，利用笔画向量放大器分解图像为矢量图形进行放大，并通过细节补全模块恢复缺失细节，采用循环策略迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，SbCA在超大规模放大任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法，生成图像质量更高。

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影和模糊，为超大规模图像超分辨率提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: SlotPi是一个基于物理知识的对象中心推理模型，解决了动态模拟中物理知识整合和模型适应性验证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对象中心动态模拟方法忽视物理知识整合和模型适应性验证，SlotPi旨在填补这些空白。

Method: SlotPi结合基于哈密顿原理的物理模块和时空预测模块，用于动态预测。

Result: 实验表明SlotPi在预测和VQA任务中表现优异，并在新创建的真实世界数据集上验证了其适应性。

Conclusion: SlotPi的强适应性为开发更先进的世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了事件相机与强化学习结合的潜力，适用于动态环境导航。

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本、基于文本查询的视频摘要方法，无需训练数据，利用视频语言模型和大型语言模型生成用户可控的摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖领域特定数据或无法结合用户自然语言意图的问题。

Method: 通过视频分段、场景描述生成、LLM评分和分数传播四个步骤实现摘要生成。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum上超越无监督方法，在QFVS基准上表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型结合提示和分数传播，为通用视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

Method: 通过集成对偶优化层和定制交互项，SmoothProper在网络前向传播中强制平滑性和消息传递。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，SmoothProper将配准误差降至1.88像素。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是首个有效解决稀疏特征和大位移挑战的无监督图像配准方法，且无需调整超参数。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡情况下表现不佳，主要因缺乏全局结构感知和推理能力。

Method: 采用目标聚焦掩码策略增强模型对遮挡区域的感知，结合多尺度特征预测SDF，并与显式点云融合。

Result: 在DexYCB和HO3Dv2基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HOMAE通过结合全局上下文和局部几何信息，有效解决了遮挡问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Method: 结合文本推理模型（LRM）和模块化多模态工具包（如检索器和视觉感知器），通过推理制定策略并选择性利用视频内容。

Result: 在MLVU、LVBench和LongVideoBench基准测试中，分别超越现有最佳模型9.6%、6.6%和3.9%。

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决LVU关键挑战中具有潜力，无需依赖复杂MLLMs。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Conclusion: PTQ4VM为视频抠图量化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了量化模型的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动了AI辅助图形设计的民主化，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设图像偏移与文本偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐现象，并提出Adaptation with Iterative Refinement（AIR）方法，迭代优化生成图像质量。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性和定量评估中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过解决偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型在目标域中的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Result: M4V在768×1280分辨率下生成视频时，FLOPs减少45%，同时提升视频质量。

Conclusion: M4V在文本到视频任务中高效且高质量，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Conclusion: 直接从视频中学习上下文图像编辑模型是可行的，且在多任务和多轮编辑场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图像对人类文明和学习至关重要，但生成此类图像需要多模态推理能力，现有模型表现不足。

Method: 提出MMMG基准，包含4,456个专家验证的图像-提示对，采用知识图谱表示，并设计MMMG-Score评估指标。

Result: 16个先进文本到图像生成模型表现不佳，GPT-4o得分仅50.20，FLUX-Reason基线模型得分为34.45。

Conclusion: MMMG基准揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason为未来研究提供了有效基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

TL;DR: CDPruner是一种新的视觉令牌修剪方法，通过最大化条件多样性来优化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉令牌修剪方法存在冗余或忽略指令相关性的问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出基于条件多样性的修剪方法CDPruner，利用DPP最大化令牌子集的多样性。

Result: 在多种MLLMs上实现SOTA性能，显著降低计算成本（如LLaVA的FLOPs减少95%）。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性优化令牌选择，在高效性和性能之间取得平衡。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: GenWorld和SpannDetector推动了AI生成视频检测领域的发展。

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Conclusion: 超二次曲面基元能高效表示复杂结构，QuadricFormer在性能和效率上均表现优异。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中实现头级注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性分工，为有效扰动策略设计提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均显著优于现有方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Result: 方法在多样数据集上展示了生成新视角合成的优越一致性和合理性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了视觉连贯且3D一致的生成式场景补全。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 新法西斯主义在西方国家迅速增长，威胁民主与少数群体，需采取行动遏制其蔓延。研究旨在填补NLP与政治科学在此领域的空白。

Method: 收集新法西斯主义论坛数据，制定编码方案并通过众包标注数据，训练和测试SLM与LLM模型。

Result: 成功开发首个新法西斯主义话语分类模型，发现此类论坛中新法西斯主义言论普遍存在。

Conclusion: 社会背景是新法西斯主义话语研究的关键，需持续对抗此类政治运动以维护民主社会。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Result: 模型在AudioCaps、WavCaps和Clotho数据集上表现出色，能够零样本执行未见过的指令。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练方法有效提升了音频理解模型的指令跟随能力，无需多任务指令调优。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Result: 在远场噪声增强的Common Voice数据集上，1分钟适应数据下词错误率相对降低20%，10分钟时提升至29%。

Conclusion: 结合条件熵和说话人编码的方法显著提升了少量数据下的语音识别适应性能。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Motivation: 尽管音频-LLM的应用发展迅速，但其底层机制（如音频编码器与LLM之间的语义表示传递）仍未被充分探索。本文旨在通过架构设计优化这种跨模态交互。

Conclusion: 通过系统性的架构设计优化，本文显著提升了音频-LLM的性能，为跨模态信息传递提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Method: 提出Omni-DPO，联合考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型学习动态，自适应加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO显著优于基线方法，甚至超越领先模型Claude 3 Opus。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过动态加权策略有效提升性能，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型（LLM）的交互式学习缺乏理论框架，本文旨在填补这一空白，为语言反馈学习提供理论基础。

Method: 作者形式化了LLF问题，提出转移逃避维度作为复杂性度量，并开发了无遗憾算法HELiX。

Result: 理论分析表明，语言反馈可以显著加速学习，HELiX在多个实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文为基于语言反馈的交互式学习提供了理论支持，HELiX算法展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TL;DR: PropInfer是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在微调过程中属性推断攻击的基准任务，揭示了LLMs在隐私保护方面的新漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在微调时是否容易泄露敏感数据属性，填补了现有研究在生成模型领域的空白。

Method: 提出了PropInfer基准任务，基于ChatDoctor数据集，设计了两种攻击方法：基于提示的生成攻击和利用词频信号的影子模型攻击。

Result: 实验证明，攻击在多预训练LLMs上成功，揭示了LLMs在隐私保护上的新漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在微调时存在属性推断风险，需加强隐私保护措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种因果表示学习框架，通过建模基准性能为少数潜在能力因素的线性变换，解决了语言模型评估中的方法挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型能力的忠实评估对模型开发至关重要，但现有方法面临混杂效应和高计算成本的挑战。

Method: 提出因果表示学习框架，将基准性能建模为潜在能力因素的线性变换，并控制基础模型作为混杂因素。

Result: 在1500多个模型的数据集上，识别出一个三节点线性因果结构，揭示了能力间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变化的重要性，为揭示潜在能力间的因果关系提供了科学依据。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的时间序列数据通常不规则且多模态，但现有基准假设数据干净且规则，导致研究与应用脱节。

Method: 提出Time-IMM数据集和IMM-TSF基准库，支持异步集成和真实评估，包含多种融合模块。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模多模态和不规则性显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为真实场景下的时间序列分析提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段方法，用于准确数字化重叠信号的心电图（ECG）记录，显著提升分割和数字化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理信号重叠的ECG记录时的局限性，提高数字化准确性。

Method: 采用U-Net分割网络和自适应网格检测模块的两阶段流程，优化信号分割和数字化。

Result: U-Net分割IoU达0.87；数字化性能优于基线，非重叠信号MSE为0.0010，重叠信号MSE为0.0029。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升ECG数字化准确性，尤其适用于信号重叠情况，为研究和临床应用提供可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是模型微调的高效替代方案，提升了医疗AI助手的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Motivation: 均匀状态离散扩散模型虽然具有自我纠正能力，但在性能上通常不及自回归模型和掩码扩散模型。本文旨在缩小这一性能差距。

Method: 利用高斯扩散的底层特性，提出了两种技术：基于高斯过程的课程学习策略和离散一致性蒸馏算法。

Result: 课程学习策略使训练速度翻倍，并在7个基准测试中的3个上零样本困惑度超越自回归模型；离散一致性蒸馏算法将采样速度提升两个数量级。

Conclusion: Duo方法通过结合高斯扩散技术，显著提升了均匀状态离散扩散模型的性能，为快速文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在高风险招聘中的应用可能加剧偏见，需探索更有效的缓解策略。

Method: 通过识别和中和模型激活中的敏感属性方向，应用仿射概念编辑。

Result: 在多种商业和开源模型中，内部缓解方法将偏见降至极低水平（通常低于1%）。

Conclusion: 建议采用更现实的评估方法和内部缓解策略，以确保招聘公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的遗忘问题日益重要，但现有方法常因数据级因素未充分探索而导致保留性能下降。

Method: GUARD引入轻量级代理数据归因指标，设计自适应非均匀遗忘权重分配目标。

Result: 实验表明，GUARD显著提升保留性能，遗忘10%数据时保留集效用牺牲减少194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD在保持遗忘效果的同时，显著提升了模型的信息保留能力。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在分布外识别中表现优异，优于对比方法和现有双曲方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: 确定性采样轨迹的几何规律为优化扩散生成模型提供了新思路，动态规划方法简单高效。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: ReGuidance是一种简单的方法，用于提升扩散模型在解决逆问题时的样本真实性和奖励效果，通过反向运行无条件概率流ODE并重新初始化DPS来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于预训练扩散模型的方法在低信噪比的逆问题中容易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。ReGuidance旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ReGuidance方法：对候选解反向运行无条件概率流ODE，生成潜在表示，并以此重新初始化DPS。

Result: 在硬逆问题（如大框修复和高倍超分辨率）中，ReGuidance显著提升了样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance是首个为DPS提供严格算法保证的方法，同时提升奖励和样本真实性。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

### [177] [Energy Aware Camera Location Search Algorithm for Increasing Precision of Observation in Automated Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10251)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种算法，优化相机在眼到手配置中的位置，以最小化图像噪声，并通过模拟验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注控制和观测架构，但忽略了相机位置对图像质量的影响，尤其是在噪声水平因环境条件变化时。

Method: 提出一种相机移动策略算法，探索工作空间以找到噪声最小的最优位置，并通过学习环境调整搜索策略。

Result: 算法成功提高了观测精度，且在有限能量下找到次优位置。

Conclusion: 该算法在眼到手配置中有效提升观测精度，无需过滤高频信息。

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积操作中填充（padding）会引入冗余信息，影响模型性能，因此需要一种无需填充的卷积方法。

Method: 结合基于域的卷积积（CP）和半张量积（STP），提出了一种新的卷积积方法，避免了填充。

Result: 开发了基于STP的CNN，成功应用于图像和三阶信号识别任务。

Conclusion: 新方法避免了填充带来的冗余信息，提升了模型性能，适用于多种信号识别任务。

Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional
inner product of vectors, which allows the factor vectors to of different
dimensions. This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP).
Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since
there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused
by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is
developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is
considered.

### [179] [From Threat to Tool: Leveraging Refusal-Aware Injection Attacks for Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10020)
*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAAI的无训练、模型无关框架，通过检测拒绝信号并注入预定义短语来生成有害但流畅的补全，用于增强LLM的安全性对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据或复杂的迭代提示，RAAI旨在提供一种简单且可扩展的替代方案。

Method: RAAI利用LLM攻击技术，通过检测内部拒绝信号并自适应注入短语，生成有害补全。

Result: 实验显示RAAI将有害响应率从基线2.15%提升至61.04%，且生成的合成数据能增强模型对有害提示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAAI展示了LLM攻击方法可作为可扩展且可控的安全性对齐工具。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

### [180] [Private Memorization Editing: Turning Memorization into a Defense to Strengthen Data Privacy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10024)
*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PME的方法，通过编辑模型对训练数据的记忆来防止私有数据泄露，将LLMs的记忆能力转化为隐私防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能记忆并泄露个人身份信息（PII），需要一种方法来防止这种隐私泄露。

Method: 通过检测和编辑模型对PII的记忆，PME在不影响模型性能的情况下增强其隐私防御能力。

Result: PME有效减少了PII泄露，某些情况下甚至将隐私攻击的准确率降为零。

Conclusion: PME是一种有效的隐私保护方法，能够在不损害模型性能的前提下提升隐私安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Method: 通过比较分析ChatGPT和Gemini的安全性和对齐水平，并实验分类越狱技术。

Result: 研究揭示了两种模型在安全性和对齐方面的差异，以及越狱技术的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMs的安全挑战需要进一步研究和技术改进。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are transforming digital usage, particularly in
text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the

### [182] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GenBreak框架通过微调大型语言模型（LLM）来系统探索文本到图像（T2I）生成器的漏洞，生成既能绕过安全机制又具有高毒性的对抗性提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估T2I模型安全性时存在局限性，缺乏可靠工具来发现真正高风险的对抗性提示。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，通过多奖励信号引导LLM生成兼具规避能力和高毒性的对抗性提示。

Result: 生成的对抗性提示在针对商业T2I生成器的黑盒攻击中表现出色，揭示了实际安全隐患。

Conclusion: GenBreak为评估T2I模型安全性提供了有效工具，揭示了其潜在安全弱点。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

### [183] [Disclosure Audits for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10171)
*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于量化对话隐私风险的审计框架CMPL，通过多轮交互测试揭示潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在处理敏感数据时存在隐私泄露风险，现有单轮防御措施不足。

Method: 提出CMPL框架，采用迭代探测策略模拟多轮对话，系统性发现隐私漏洞。

Result: CMPL能够揭示现有单轮防御无法检测的隐私风险，并提供量化风险指标和开放基准。

Conclusion: CMPL作为一种诊断工具，为对话隐私审计提供了有效方法和评估标准。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现某些机器学习遗忘方法在简单提示攻击下可能失效，部分方法如ELM仍易受攻击，需改进评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证机器学习遗忘方法的有效性，揭示其在提示攻击下的脆弱性。

Method: 系统评估八种遗忘技术，采用输出、logit和探针分析。

Result: 部分方法（如RMU、TAR）表现稳健，但ELM在特定攻击下恢复57.3%准确率。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法有效性存疑，需开发可靠评估框架区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究利用量子密码学（如QKD、BB84协议和QOTP）增强云计算中的数据安全性，以应对未来量子计算机的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据安全方法在未来量子计算机时代可能不足，需探索更强大的保护手段。

Method: 采用量子密钥分发（QKD）和BB84协议生成安全密钥，结合量子一次性密码本（QOTP）进行数据加密。

Result: 研究证明量子密码学方法能有效保护云数据，抵御包括量子计算在内的攻击。

Conclusion: 量子密码学为云计算提供了当前和未来的安全解决方案，提升数据存储和共享的安全性。

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

### [186] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的新型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），解决了传统方法在精度、重叠问题和2D到3D扩展中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度低、极端情况下重叠以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计的问题。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，引入强制密度均匀性和几何规律性的损失函数，并采用分层方法预测变换。

Result: LDEM在密度均衡和双射性方面优于现有方法，且能无缝扩展到3D。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的实用化提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、基于真实人体的服装数据集采集方法，并引入混合人物表示以提升虚拟试衣的准确性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法受限于前视图和实时性，且依赖昂贵的机器人模型，无法准确模拟人体变形。

Method: 使用真实人体采集数据集，结合简化的DensePose图改进中间表示，实现服装与人体精准对齐。

Result: 在图像质量和时间一致性上优于现有方法，用户研究表明系统有助于服装购买决策。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数据采集门槛，提升了虚拟试衣的实用性和用户体验。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

TL;DR: Edit360是一个无需调整的框架，将2D图像编辑扩展到多视角一致的3D编辑，利用视频扩散模型实现任意视角的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视角一致性3D编辑上受限，Edit360旨在解决这一问题，提供更灵活的编辑能力。

Method: 基于视频扩散模型，通过Anchor-View Editing Propagation机制在多视角间传播编辑。

Result: 实现了高质量的多视角序列编辑，支持可定制的3D内容生成。

Conclusion: Edit360为3D资产编辑提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的动态校准方法，用于稀疏惯性运动捕捉系统，首次打破了IMU校准中的绝对静态假设，显著扩展了应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖于绝对静态假设，限制了其应用场景。本文旨在通过动态校准方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过两个放宽的假设（矩阵变化在短时间内可忽略，且运动/读数多样化），利用Transformer模型学习矩阵与IMU读数的映射关系，并设计校准触发器。

Result: 实现了隐式IMU校准和长期准确的稀疏IMU运动捕捉。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了无需显式校准的IMU使用，并显著提升了稀疏IMU的长期运动捕捉精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间感知知识蒸馏的框架，用于从鞋垫传感器数据中估计地面反作用力（GRF），解决了便携式传感器噪声和精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跑步机测量GRF成本高且不便携，而便携式鞋垫传感器虽成本低但精度不足。

Method: 采用时间感知知识蒸馏框架，利用小批次内的相似性和时序特征，捕捉特征间的互补关系和数据的时序特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GRF估计上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为便携式GRF测量提供了一种高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AniMaker是一个多智能体框架，用于从文本输入生成连贯的多场景动画，通过高效的多候选片段生成和故事感知片段选择，解决现有方法的叙事不连贯和视觉连续性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在多场景和角色转换中表现不佳，生成的动画常因片段质量不一致而影响整体逻辑和视觉连贯性。

Method: AniMaker采用多智能体框架，包括导演、摄影、评审和后期制作智能体，结合MCTS-Gen和AniEval技术优化片段生成和评估。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在VBench和AniEval等指标上表现优异，显著提升了多候选生成的效率和动画质量。

Conclusion: AniMaker通过智能体协作和新技术应用，推动了AI生成故事动画向生产标准迈进。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为SFE的基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在科学认知能力上的表现，发现当前模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学基准主要关注MLLMs的知识理解能力，而忽略了感知和推理能力的评估，因此需要更全面的测试标准。

Method: 设计了SFE基准，包含830个专家验证的VQA问题，覆盖66个多模态任务，分为三个层次：科学信号感知、科学属性理解和科学比较推理。

Result: 当前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在SFE上的表现仅为34.08%和26.52%，表明MLLMs在科学领域有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: SFE的提出有望推动AI在科学发现中的进一步发展。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Conclusion: ToxiMol为分子毒性修复任务提供了首个基准，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将Levy的按值调用推送值λ演算（CBPV）编码到π演算的方法，并证明了其正确性和完备性。编码针对内部π演算（π-i-演算）进行了优化，解决了de Bruijn索引在形式化中的问题，并简化了双模拟验证。此外，编码还符合Gorla提出的五项良好编码标准，并与Milner的编码进行了比较。论文还展示了CBPV在异步多态π演算和局部π演算中的编码，并开始在Coq中形式化证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何将CBPV编码到π演算中，以解决形式化验证中的技术难题，并验证编码的正确性和完备性。

Method: 提出了一种针对π-i-演算的编码方法，通过手工证明验证了其正确性和完备性，并讨论了编码符合Gorla标准。

Result: 编码被证明是正确且完备的，双模拟验证得到简化，且编码符合良好编码标准。

Conclusion: 该编码方法在π演算中有效，为CBPV的形式化验证提供了新途径，并展示了在多种π演算变体中的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAGIC的多模态心脏亚结构分割方法，基于nnU-Net架构，能够高效处理不同模态和重叠结构的分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏亚结构在胸部放射治疗中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在多模态和重叠结构分割上缺乏通用性。

Method: MAGIC通过复制的编码和解码分支实现多模态分割，使用Sim-CT、MR-Linac和CCTA三种模态数据进行训练和测试。

Result: MAGIC在57%的案例中优于对比模型，平均DSC分数为0.75（Sim-CT）、0.68（MR-Linac）和0.80（CCTA）。

Conclusion: MAGIC提供了一种轻量级且高效的多模态分割解决方案，适合临床实施。

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

Conclusion: 模块化框架为可扩展和高效的导航系统奠定了基础，未来可通过增强环境先验和扩展多模态输入进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The
diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets
are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI.
However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on

enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and
photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale
in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can
be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained
physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.
EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key
modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object
Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates
diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal

Motivation: 交通场景中事故预测（TAA）存在数据偏差和背景混淆问题，现有方法依赖标注且难以捕捉真实因果关系。

Method: 提出AVD模型，通过文本提示生成因果视频帧，并结合EQ-TAA方法使用对比损失优化。

Result: 实验表明AVD和EQ-TAA性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AVD和EQ-TAA有效解决了TAA中的背景混淆问题，无需额外标注。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应双模态框架，通过动态分支选择器、双向跨模态GAN和混合训练协议，显著提升了HER2评估的准确性，同时降低了资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HER2评估模型通常单独分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床需要两者的协同解释。由于工作流程复杂性和成本限制，同时获取两种模态存在困难。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器根据输入完整性激活单模态重建或双模态联合推理；2) 双向跨模态GAN实现缺失模态的上下文感知特征空间重建；3) 混合训练协议结合对抗学习和多任务优化。

Result: 单模态H&E预测准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态准确率达95.09%，仅IHC输入时可靠性为90.28%。跨模态重建显著提升了F1分数。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态路由输入和弹性架构，在资源有限的环境中实现了接近双模态的性能，为HER2评估的普及提供了潜力。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层知识图谱框架，用于视觉叙事的结构化理解，支持多模态推理和叙事任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过多层级知识图谱捕捉视觉叙事中的语义、空间和时间关系，以支持故事结构、角色连续性和事件进展的推理。

Method: 将叙事内容分解为多个层级，构建集成知识图谱，链接视觉元素与文本组件，并在Manga109数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在动作检索、对话追踪、角色出场映射和面板时间线重建等任务中表现出高精度和高召回率。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于叙事的视觉媒体内容分析、交互式故事讲述和多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖文本分析，忽视了非语言信息中的丰富语义内容，导致意图识别不够准确。

Method: 提出小波驱动的融合模块和跨模态交互机制，实现视频-音频特征的频域同步分解与集成，逐步增强特征。

Conclusion: WDMIR框架通过频域分析和跨模态交互，有效提升了多模态意图识别的准确性，尤其在非语言信息处理上表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在分割增强脑肿瘤区域时性能下降，主要因未充分考量MRI特异性特征。

Method: 提出HFF-Net，包含FDD模块分解频域、ALC模块动态增强高频细节、FDCA模块融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，平均Dice分数提升4.48%，增强肿瘤区域分割提升7.33%。

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCELLA的双头条件方法，结合非医学大型语言模型和病理分类，解决了医学LDM训练中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了合成图像质量和分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学LDM训练常因数据稀缺和性能限制策略（如依赖短提示文本编码器或非医学LDM）而受限，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出了CCELLA方法，通过交叉注意力将非医学大型语言模型编码的文本特征与病理分类结合，并设计了联合损失函数和数据高效的LDM训练框架。

Result: 在有限的前列腺MRI数据集上，3D FID得分达0.025，显著优于基础模型（FID 0.071）。合成图像提升了分类器准确率（69%到74%），且仅用合成图像训练的分类器性能接近真实图像。

Conclusion: CCELLA方法在数据有限的情况下显著提升了医学图像合成质量和分类器性能，为医学LDM训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

Result: 模型在合成和真实病理数据集上表现优异，优于变分自编码器和其他扩散模型，甚至超过部分监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督异常检测中表现突出，为罕见疾病诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DUN-SRE的新型深度展开网络，用于动态MRI重建，通过时空旋转等变性显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态MRI中存在空间和时间对称性，现有方法未能有效利用时间对称性，限制了重建质量。

Method: 设计了(2+1)D等变卷积架构，将数据一致性和近端映射模块统一到深度展开框架中，确保时空旋转对称性约束的严格传播。

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上，DUN-SRE表现出色，尤其在保留旋转对称结构方面，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE通过有效利用时空对称性，显著提升了动态MRI重建的性能和准确性。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: SWDL-Net是一种新型半监督学习框架，结合拉普拉斯金字塔和深度卷积上采样，显著提升了颅内出血（ICH）分割的精度，尤其在标注数据稀缺的情况下。


<details>

Motivation: 由于颅内出血（ICH）标注数据获取困难且成本高，传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据的局限性凸显，因此提出半监督学习（SSL）解决方案。

Method: SWDL-Net通过拉普拉斯金字塔的边缘锐化能力和深度卷积的细节增强特性，设计了一种差异学习机制，有效整合两者的互补优势。

Result: 在仅有2%标注数据的ICH数据集和公开基准测试中，SWDL-Net表现优于现有方法；在BHSD数据集上5%标注数据下也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net为医学图像分割中的标注数据稀缺问题提供了一种高效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

Result: 多域实验表明，ConStyX在泛化性能上表现优异。

Conclusion: ConStyX有效解决了域泛化问题，提升了医学图像分割的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy

Conclusion: Med-URWKV展示了预训练RWKV在医学图像分割中的潜力，性能优越且代码将开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.
