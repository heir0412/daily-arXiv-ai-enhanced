### [1] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于复数空间语义吸引子的理论框架，通过张量变换和循环操作构建语义AGI，替代传统的统计预测模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的语言模型依赖统计预测，无法真正理解语义。需要构建能够处理反讽、多义性和模糊性的语义模型，实现真正的语义理解而非模拟

Method: 使用复数空间中的循环操作和虚数单位i，建立旋转语义结构。核心是语义吸引子（Microvitum）作为目的性算子，通过梯度流、张量变形和迭代矩阵动力学引导语义向稳定和清晰收敛

Result: 提出了一个数学上具有启发性、哲学上重要的语义转换模型，能够处理复杂的语义现象如反讽和歧义

Conclusion: 真正的语义不是通过模拟产生，而是通过向语义一致性的递归收敛实现的，这需要一种全新的认知架构来塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

### [2] [LLMs Can't Handle Peer Pressure: Crumbling under Multi-Agent Social Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18321)
*Maojia Song,Tej Deep Pala,Weisheng Jin,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Dorien Herremans,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAIROS是一个模拟问答竞赛的多智能体基准测试，研究LLM如何基于历史印象建立信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，发现GRPO强化学习方法在结合多智能体上下文和基于结果的奖励时表现最佳，但降低了社交影响的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在多智能体系统中如何通过同伴互动形成信任、抵抗错误信息并整合输入，这些因素对于复杂社交动态下实现集体智能至关重要。

Method: 提出KAIROS基准测试，模拟不同可靠性智能体参与的问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声群体和对抗性同伴等条件。评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（GRPO）等缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理实现了最佳整体性能，但相比基础模型降低了社交影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多智能体环境中的强化学习（GRPO）能有效提升LLM的集体决策性能，但需要平衡性能提升与社交影响鲁棒性之间的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

TL;DR: LangCrUX数据集分析显示多语言网站普遍忽视无障碍提示，导致屏幕阅读器效能降低，为此提出Kizuki扩展工具来解决语言不一致性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英语主导网络但多语言内容增长，辅助技术对非拉丁文字支持不足，缺乏大规模多语言网络内容数据集限制了相关研究

Method: 构建LangCrUX数据集（12种非拉丁文字的12万个流行网站），进行系统性多语言网络无障碍分析，开发Kizuki语言感知自动化无障碍测试扩展

Result: 发现无障碍提示往往无法反映可见内容的语言多样性，广泛存在对无障碍提示的忽视，降低了屏幕阅读器效果

Conclusion: 多语言网络无障碍存在严重问题，需要语言感知的自动化测试工具来改善屏幕阅读器在多语言环境中的表现

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

*Yuchun Fan,Yilin Wang,Yongyu Mu,Lei Huang,Bei Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAST是一种通过精确语言特定层微调来高效提升大型视觉语言模型多语言能力的训练方法，仅需调整14%参数即可显著改善多语言理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力上存在不平衡，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活来识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对这些层进行精确微调以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升多语言能力，仅调整14%参数就实现显著效率提升

Conclusion: PLAST方法可推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务，促进浅层语言特定视觉信息参与，为多语言视觉语言模型提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

### [5] [Backprompting: Leveraging Synthetic Production Data for Health Advice Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18384)
*Kellen Tan Cheng,Anna Lisa Gentile,Chad DeLuca,Guang-Jie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了backprompting方法，通过生成生产级别的标签数据来改善健康建议监测器的性能，并在参数较少的情况下超过GPT-4o的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在企业环境中带来风险，监测器需要生产级别的标签数据进行训练，但实际部署前获取真实LLM输出的标签数据很困难。

Method: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级别的标签数据，结合稀疏人巡环聚类技术进行标注，构建与原始数据集并行但类似真实LLM输出的语料库。

Result: 在健康建议识别这个难题上，该监测器表现超过GPT-4o达3.73%，而参数数量仅为其的1/400。

Conclusion: backprompting方法能有效生成高质量标签数据，为开发健壁监测器提供了可靠的数据支持，在复杂场景中供显著性能提升。

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

### [6] [Integral Transformer: Denoising Attention, Not Too Much Not Too Little](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18387)
*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Integral Transformer，通过从logit分布中采样信号来整合注意力，有效降噪同时保留特殊标记的关键信息，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Cog Attention和Differential Transformer虽然通过引入负注意力分数解决了注意力噪声问题，但可能会丢弃有用信息，特别是对模型性能至关重要的特殊标记。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过整合从logit分布中采样的信号来降噪注意力，同时保留特殊标记的贡献。

Result: 在知识推理基准测试中优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体，能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层rank collapse。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer在降噪的同时保留了关键信息，下层使用vanilla自注意力能提升性能，上层能有效平衡注意力分布。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [7] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) 是一种新的解码方法，使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短式和长式推理任务上均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率解码方法在复杂或长式问题上输出不一致，Self-Consistency仅适用于短式QA，而Universal Self-Consistency和WUCS在长式回答上有效但在短式基准上准确性下降。

Method: LSC通过可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，使用轻量级的前向生成摘要token，推理时间增加不到1%，无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在6个短式和5个长式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有短式和长式任务上平均超越了SC、USC和WUCS，同时保持可忽略的计算开销，并提供良好校准的置信度估计。

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，在保持低计算开销的同时提供可靠性能和良好校准的置信度估计。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

### [8] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文质疑了当前AI模型通过离散分布(OOD)数据集评估泛化能力的偏差，发现不同OOD数据集对模型弊迹的评估质量差异巨大，某些甚至较内部评估更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI领域通过OOD数据集评估模型泛化能力的方法建立在一个强假设上：OOD评估能够抓取和反映真实世界部署中可能的失败。论文要挑战这个偏侠的偏见。

Method: 将OOD评估的结果与现有问答(QA)模型中文档化的特定失败模式进行对比，具体考察模型依赖偏差特征或预测短便的问题。

Result: 发现不同用于QA领域OOD评估的数据集提供的模型弊迹稳健性估计质量差异巨大，某些数据集的表现甚至远超不及简单的内部分布评估。还发现偏差短便在ID和OOD数据集之间存在共享现象。

Conclusion: 常用的基于OOD的泛化评估方法存在明显限制。论文提供了更稳健评估问答及其他领域泛化能力的方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [9] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析不同训练方法对LLM在重排序任务中语义理解的影响，研究模型是否能生成更好的文本推理来提高透明度和应对有限训练数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力提升，其透明性下降，且在新系统中缺乏足够排名数据时准确重排序面临挑战。需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制来提供可解释的推理。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域相对较小的排名数据集进行内容重排序，分析不同训练方法对语义理解的影响，并检验可解释信息是否能用于推理重排序决策。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法具有更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究LLM训练方法对其语义理解和可解释性的影响，以确保模型的真实可靠性，并为用户提供透明的决策解释。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [10] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina Wróblewska,Bartosz Żuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过IPIS数据集微调大语言模型，为波兰语设计性别包容性系统提示，旨在解决波兰语中男性化偏见问题，使模型生成更性别平衡的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语由于历史和政治惯例，主要使用男性形式指代男性、女性和混合性别群体，导致大语言模型继承并强化了这种性别偏见，产生性别不平衡的输出。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（包含人工制作的波兰语性别包容性校对和波兰语到英语翻译指令）微调多语言LLMs（Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo）和波兰语特定LLMs（Bielik和PLLuM），并基于理论语言学框架设计包含明确性别包容性指南的系统提示。

Result: 通过IPIS微调方法，成功将性别包容性整合为大语言模型的内在特征，为缓解波兰语生成中的性别偏见提供了系统性解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了波兰语LLMs中的性别偏见问题，为构建更公平的语言模型提供了可行途径，具有重要的社会意义和应用价值。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

### [11] [Principled Detection of Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Multiple Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18473)
*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多重检验假设测试的方法来检测大语言模型的幻觉问题，将幻觉检测视为假设检验问题，并与机器学习中的分布外检测问题进行类比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然强大但容易产生幻觉（生成看似自信但实际错误或无意义的回答），需要有效的方法来检测这些幻觉。

Method: 将幻觉检测问题表述为假设检验问题，借鉴多重检验的方法论，提出了一种新的检测方法。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提方法的鲁棒性，相比现有最先进方法表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大语言模型幻觉提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

### [12] [COMET-poly: Machine Translation Metric Grounded in Other Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18549)
*Maike Züfle,Vilém Zouhar,Tu Anh Dinh,Felipe Maia Polo,Jan Niehues,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的机器翻译评估指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过综合多个翻译版本或相似源文本的评分信息，显著提升了与人类评判的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器翻译自动评估指标只考虑单个翻译版本，而人类评测者通常会在多个翻译版本之间进行对比评估，这种设置差异可能影响自动评估的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句子的多个翻译版本进行对比分析；COMET-polyic受到基于检索的上下文学习的启发，采用相似源文本的翻译及其人类评分来指导评估。

Result: 结果显示，COMET-polycand加入一个额外翻译版本后，段落级评估性能提升了0.079到0.118（Kendall's tau-b相关系数），加入更多翻译版本后进一步提升。COMET-polyic通过检索示例也实现了类似的收益（0.079到0.116）。

Conclusion: 研究证明，在机器翻译评估中综合多个翻译版本或相似源文本的信息可以显著提高自动评估指标的性能，更好地模仿人类评测者的评估方式。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

*Girish A. Koushik,Fatemeh Nazarieh,Katherine Birch,Shenbin Qian,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个自评估视觉隐喻生成框架，通过源-目标-意义分解提示和轻量级强化学习来提升隐喻对齐效果，在多项指标上超越强基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言含义和保持视觉连贯性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面存在挑战，需要更好的评估和改进机制。

Method: 提出自评估框架，包含训练无关的S-T-M分解提示管道和训练基础的强化学习管道，使用新提出的隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标进行自我评估。

Result: 训练无关方法在分解、CLIP和MA分数上超越GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线，用户研究显示GPT-4o整体更受欢迎，但开源方法在抽象隐喻上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级RL在有限计算资源下能有效进行隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置敏感性。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

### [14] [What do language models model? Transformers, automata, and the format of thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18598)
*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文主张大语言模型主要是对训练语料库的模式，而非人类语言能力的模拟，因为变换器架构的线性处理格式与人类超线性计算格式存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型的本质：它们是否反映人类语言能力，还是仅仅对训练语料库的模式化。论文为后者提供了非缩减性的辩护。

Method: 通过计算机科学的视角分析，使用变换器架构的计算不变量来证明其线性处理格式的限制，并引用Liu等人(2022)关于短接自动机的理论来描述变换器的实际工作机制。

Result: 论证显示变换器架构最多支持线性处理格式，而人类语言能力依赖超线性计算格式，因此LLMs主要是对语料库的模式化，而非人类语言能力的模拟。

Conclusion: 语言不仅仅是表达内部状态的工具，而是一种"话语机器"，能够在适当情境下生成新语言。人类和LLMs都学会了使用这种技术，但通过完全不同的方式实现。

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

*Rumeng Li,Xun Wang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOOV是一个新的神经机器翻译系统，专门用于将电子健康记录从英语翻译到西班牙语，通过整合双语词典和短语查找表来解决未知词和重复词问题，无需大量平行语料训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)的英西翻译具有重要临床意义，但面临缺乏平行语料和大量未知词汇的挑战。

Method: 提出NOOV系统，整合从平行语料自动学习的双语词典和从大型生物医学知识资源提取的短语查找表，缓解NMT中的未知词和词重复问题。

Result: 评估显示NOOV能够生成更好的EHR翻译，在准确性和流畅性方面都有改进。

Conclusion: NOOV系统有效解决了临床EHR翻译中的关键挑战，为医疗领域的跨语言信息交流提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究建立了任务分层缩放定律，揭示了语言模型语音后量化对不同知识能力的影响差异，发现知识记忆比知识利用更容易受量化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型语音后量化(PTQ)影响知识能力的系统理解，且量化模型缩放定律常忽略PTQ特定参数和任务敏感性。

Method: 进行广泛的实验研究，将LLM知识解构为记忆和利用能力，建立包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和组大小的统一量化框架。

Result: 发现知识记忆能力在有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小变化时显示出明显更高的敏感性，而知识利用能力更加稳健。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

TL;DR: 论文提出TBYS框架，通过在推理步骤间插入主动生成的insights来弥补LLMs在复杂推理任务中的不足，无需人工标注或微调即可显著提升数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据缺乏人类推理过程中的关键思维过程（意图和方法论），这些内部思考往往没有被明确表达出来。

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤之间主动生成insights来回顾状态并启动下一步推理。设计自动化流水线收集和筛选上下文示例来生成insights，避免人工标注和微调开销。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insights来模拟人类推理过程中的内部思考，可以有效提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，该方法无需额外的人工标注或模型微调。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

TL;DR: 通过动态整合外部知识和模型内部知识的输出概率，突破了大语言模型在忠实性和表达力之间的交易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在整合外部知识时无法同时保持忠实性和表达力的问题，避免输出要么缺乏知识支持要么过于繁琐不自然。

Method: 提出协同解码(CoDe)方法，基于分布散度和模型信心度动态整合有无外部知识的输出概率，并采用知识感知重排机制防止过度依赖参数知识。

Result: 通过完善的实验验证，CoDe框架在各种大语言模型和评估指标上都显示出优异性能，在提升忠实性的同时不損害表达力。

Conclusion: CoDe作为一种即插即用的框架，有效解决了大语言模型在知识基础回答中的忠实性与表达力的交易问题，具有良好的效果和普适性。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型缺乏对用户语音中丰富情感和副语言线索的深度理解，且需要大量数据和计算资源来训练共情能力

Method: 提出新颖的Emotion Omni模型架构，并基于开源TTS框架开发数据生成流水线，构建了20万条情感对话数据集

Result: 成功构建了支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构，能够理解用户语音情感并生成相应的共情语音响应

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决有限数据下语音LLM的共情响应生成问题提供了有效方案，提升了人机交互的情感理解能力

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

TL;DR: 通过结合模型感知难度和本质样本复杂性的平衡难度采样策略，提出了一种新的多模态思维链提示案例选择框架，显著提升了MLLM模型的性能稳定性和决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态思维链(MCoT)提示方法通常使用随机或手动选择的示例，这些示例无法考虑模型特定的知识分布和任务的本质复杂性，导致模型性能次优且不稳定。

Method: 受教育学"个性化教学平衡难度"原则启发，将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题。方法整合两种信号：(1)模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧量化）；(2)本质样本复杂性（测量问题-图像对的内在难度）。通过联合分析这些信号，开发了难度平衡的采样策略。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的标准测试集和多个流行多模态大语言模型(MLLM)上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法带来了显著且一致的性能提升，大大减少了随机采样导致的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有理论基础的健壃方法，用于提升多模态推理能力，通过系统性地选择与模型当前能力相符合的训练示例，有效解决了传统提示方法的局限性。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 当前医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在回答一致性问题，面对语义相同的医学问题重述时表现脆弱。研究构建了RoMed数据集并提出了CCL方法，显著提升了模型鲁棒性和回答一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗应用中，确保模型对不同表述的医学问题给出一致回答至关重要。研究发现当前Med-VLMs在面对语义等效的问题重述时存在严重的回答波动问题，这会影响诊断的可靠性。

Method: 构建了RoMed数据集（包含14.4万个问题，涵盖词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动），并提出了CCL方法，包含知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习两个核心组件。

Result: 在RoMed数据集上评估SOTA模型（如LLaVA-Med）时发现性能显著下降（如召回率下降40%）。CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并在RoMed测试集上将回答一致性提升了50%。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前Med-VLMs存在严重的鲁棒性问题，提出的CCL方法通过知识对齐和偏差缓解有效提升了模型的回答一致性和鲁棒性，为医疗AI的可靠性提供了重要改进。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域表现良好，但在处理领域特定术语和新词时准确率不足，需要专门的方法来提升术语识别能力

Method: Attention2Probability方法将语音与术语之间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习策略提高检索准确性

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中英文最大召回率分别达到92.57%和86.83%，单查询延迟仅8.71ms，术语准确率提升6-17%

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、灵活且准确，有效解决了语音大模型在术语识别方面的局限性，同时发布了新的术语语音数据集支持后续研究

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示策略(零样本、少样本、思维链)在多语言谜语生成中倾向于重用记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写，缺乏真正的创造性和文化适应性。

Method: 引入自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对上的评估显示，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性提升且冗余减少。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下，指导文化基础扎实的创造性生成。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Conclusion: M3HG模型和多模态多场景的MECAD数据集有效解决了MECTEC任务中的关键挑战，为多模态对话分析提供了新的解决方案和基准资源。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构连贯段落和保持时间顺序来提升长上下文问答性能，在NarrativeQA数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的时序关系，而不仅仅是孤立的片段检索。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：将分散的文档信息重构为连贯的结构化段落；通过显式捕获和维护检索段落的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验表明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答任务至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门处理叙事文本的时序特性，显著提升了长上下文问答的性能。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

Conclusion: ThinkDial框架有效解决了LLM推理计算开销控制问题，为开源社区提供了实用的可控推理解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于规则强化学习的新框架，通过导向大语言模型的推理能力来提升中文语法错误编正性能，获得了独到的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的语法错误编正研究主要依赖监督细调，让大语言模型直接生成修正后的句子，这限制了模型强大的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种新题的基于规则强化学习（Rule-Based RL）的框架，通过引导大语言模型进行推理来完成语法错误编正任务。

Result: 在中文数据集上达到了独到的性能，尤其是在可叐率指标上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 证明了使用强化学习导向大语言模型的优势，为语法错误编正领域提供了更可控制和可靠的发展范式。

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Motivation: 现代机器翻译系统在通用文本上表现优异，但在翻译包含数学公式、表格、图表和交叉引用等结构化元素的LaTeX文档时仍面临重大挑战，需要准确保持语义完整性和可编译性。

Method: 采用六种专门化智能体协作：1)解析器通过占位符替换和语法过滤分解LaTeX；2)翻译器、验证器、总结器和术语提取器确保上下文感知、自校正和术语一致的翻译；3)生成器将翻译内容重构为结构良好的LaTeX文档。

Result: 实验结果表明，LaTeXTrans在翻译准确性和结构保真度方面都能超越主流机器翻译系统。

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans为翻译LaTeX格式文档提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，能够很好地保持格式保存、结构保真和术语一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Motivation: 数字时代虚假信息泛滥，现有方法难以捕捉长距离依赖、复杂语义关系和新闻传播的社会动态，且需要大量标注数据

Method: 结合抽象意义表示(AMR)的复杂语义关系和新闻传播动态，使用LLM生成负样本的图对比损失(LGCL)，以及多视图图掩码自编码器学习社交上下文特征

Result: 大量实验表明，该自监督框架在有限标注数据下仍优于最先进方法，并提高了泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合语义和传播特征，在自监督方式下成功区分真假新闻，为解决虚假信息检测问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

<details>

Motivation: 当前LLMs在关键领域部署时经常表现出过度自信，生成错误答案但置信度很高，现有校准方法效果有限且泛化性不足。

Method: 提出ConfTuner微调方法，使用理论证明为proper scoring rule的tokenized Brier score损失函数，无需真实置信度标签或代理估计。

Result: 在多种推理任务上显著改善校准效果，并能泛化到黑盒模型如GPT-4o，更好的校准置信度带来下游自校正和模型级联的性能提升。

Conclusion: ConfTuner推进了可信LLM系统的发展，通过简单高效的微调方法有效解决了LLMs过度自信问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt通过反射进化方法显著提升了自动提示的性能，证明了在进化过程中积累和更新知识的重要性，为自动提示领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)领域的研究者通常缺乏资源进行大规模严谨研究，需要一种能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大型语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模研究。

Result: 使用计算教育数据集展示了LACA方法在可重复和严谨分析中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: LACA方法在CER领域具有重要潜力，能够从更广泛的研究中获得更可推广的发现，有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

Motivation: 研究欧洲议会中是否存在情感两极化现象，即政治论迹中对立场对立组织的负面情绪咀恨态度的增加。

Method: 采用自动化自然语言处理技术，分析六个欧洲国家议会议员的演讲语料，通过比较对对立组织咀自己组织的负面情绪表达来评估情感两极化。

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了一致的情感两极化现象，议员活跃度与负面情绪呈正相关，但活跃度高低与情感两极化程度无关。

Conclusion: 情感两极化在欧洲议会中普遍存在，互恶是议员之间情感两极化的重要驱动机制。

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估主要集中在性能指标上，而忽视了评估数据集的设计质量和隐私保护等实际约束需求。

Method: 使用三个模块化段代理：多样性段代理通过聚类提升主题覆盖范围，隐私段代理检测和隐藏敏感信息，QA编辑段代理生成合适的问答对。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条符合道德规范的实用路径，能够实现更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估，为未来遵循AI监管要求的提升奠定基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在复杂长时程规划任务中缺乏宏观指导，容易迷失方向，并且在执行过程中缺乏持续监督，无法适应环境变化和纠正偏差。

Method: 采用分层规划框架：离线阶段从专家演示构建里程碑库，支持结构化经验复用；执行阶段动态适配轨迹片段生成逐步提示，将当前观察与里程碑目标对齐。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的基准测试中，HiPlan显著优于强基线方法，消融研究验证了其分层组件的互补效益。

Conclusion: HiPlan通过提供自适应全局-局部指导，有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的方向迷失和偏差问题，提升了决策性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

### [44] [It's All About In-Context Learning! Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089)
*Yue Li,Zhixue Zhao,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面分析了LLMs能否通过上下文学习(ICL)来获取极低资源语言，比较了有无辅助对齐信号的情况，并与参数高效微调(PEFT)进行了对比。研究发现对于语言和文字都极度缺乏表示的极低资源语言，PEFT存在局限性，而零样本ICL加语言对齐效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言，特别是使用罕见文字的语言，在大语言模型中缺乏支持，主要原因是训练数据匮乏。本文旨在探索LLMs是否能够通过上下文学习来获取这些语言能力。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三个最先进的多语言LLMs上测试了零样本/少样本ICL（有/无语言对齐）和PEFT方法的性能。

Result: 研究发现：对于语言和文字都极度缺乏表示的极低资源语言，PEFT存在明显局限性；零样本ICL加语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著；少样本ICL或PEFT对相对较好表示的语言更有效。

Conclusion: 为LLM实践者提供了基于结果的指导原则：避免在未见文字的语言上微调多语言模型，对于极低资源语言优先使用零样本ICL加语言对齐方法。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

*Mathew Henrickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的艺术品溯源研究框架，用于处理Getty Provenance Index中的多语言、碎片化档案数据，通过语义检索和上下文摘要实现自然语言搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术品溯源研究对于验证真伪、支持归还和法律主张至关重要，但当前搜索门户需要精确元数据，限制了探索性搜索。多语言碎片化档案数据阻碍了高效检索。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合语义检索和上下文摘要技术，实现对Getty Provenance Index - German Sales中10,000条拍卖记录的检索和摘要分析。

Result: 该方法能够有效检索和总结拍卖记录，减少对元数据结构的依赖，为艺术市场档案导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为历史学家和文化遗产专业人士进行历史敏感性研究提供了实用工具，能够有效处理多语言碎片化艺术品溯源数据。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合透明的定量话语分析框架，结合词汇和语义方法，以解决依赖黑盒软件导致的方法论透明性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和计算工具的兴起，定量话语分析应用日益普及，但依赖MAXQDA和NVivo等黑盒软件容易影响方法论透明性和与研究目标的一致性。

Method: 提出了使用NLTK、spaCy和Sentence Transformers的自定义Python流水线，包括迭代式BERTopic模型建立过程，结合UMAP降维、HDBSCAN聚类和c-TF-IDF关键词提取，通过参数调整和多次运行优化主题相关性和覆盖范围。

Result: 通过历史政治话语案例研究，证明了该框架能够实现三角测量、可复现性和可解释性，同时缩小了单纯词汇或语义方法的限制。

Conclusion: 该工作流突出了代码层面透明性、研究者主动性和方法论三角测量在计算话语研究中的重要性，为定量话语分析提供了更透明、可控的方法论框架。

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答中存在幻觉问题，本文研究其知识边界感知能力，评估三种置信度信号，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具备强大的视觉问答能力，但存在幻觉问题，可靠的模型应该能够感知自己的知识边界。

Method: 评估三种置信度信号：概率置信度、答案一致性置信度和语言化置信度，并采用LLM中的置信度校准方法进行改进。

Result: 实验表明LVLMs具有一定程度的感知能力但仍有改进空间，概率和一致性信号更可靠，语言化置信度容易导致过度自信。

Conclusion: 视觉和文本联合处理会降低问答性能但减少置信度，相比LLMs提升了感知水平，提出了三种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面的科学推理评测基准，且很少系统性地分析知识与推理在科学任务中的不同作用

Method: 引入SciReas评测套件和SciReas-Pro子集，提出KRUX探测框架来分离知识与推理的作用，并进行深入分析

Result: 发现知识检索是LLM科学推理的关键瓶颈，外部知识能显著提升推理性能，增强推理能力有助于提取任务相关知识

Conclusion: 科学推理需要同时关注知识获取和推理能力，提出了有效的评测框架和分析方法，并提供了强基线模型

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

Motivation: 为了解决长语音合成中多说话人对话建模的挑战，需要一种能够高效处理长序列并保持音频保真度的方法

Method: 采用next-token扩散方法，通过自回归生成潜在向量来建模连续数据，并引入新型连续语音分词器实现高效数据压缩

Result: 相比流行的Encodec模型，数据压缩率提高80倍，音频保真度保持相当，能够在64K上下文窗口中合成长达90分钟的4人对话语音

Conclusion: VibeVoice在长语音合成方面超越了开源和专有对话模型，能够有效捕捉真实的对话氛围

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

TL;DR: 本文调查平函语言摘要的可读性评估方法，发现传统可读性指标与人类判断相关性弱，而语言模型能更好地预测可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前平函语言摘要预测主要使用传统可读性指标，但这些指标在该领域的有效性尚未经过人类判断验证。

Method: 评估8种可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并测试语言模型在可读性预测中的表现。

Result: 大部分传统指标与人类判断相关性弱，最佳语言模型达到Pearson相关系数0.56，能更好抓取深层可读性特征。

Conclusion: 建议在平函语言摘要评估中采用语言模型替代传统指标，并提供了最佳实践建议。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型采用线性请求-响应格式，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，需要更自适应和交互式的交互方式

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面范式，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面

Result: 生成式界面在多样化任务、交互模式和查询类型中一致优于对话式界面，人类用户偏好度超过70%

Conclusion: 研究阐明了用户何时以及为何偏好生成式界面，为未来人机交互的进步铺平了道路

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D目标检测方法：基于物理模拟的神经网络方法和基于模板匹配的几何方法，发现在真实声纳数据中模板匹配方法（83% mAP）比神经网络方法（40% mAP）表现更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D目标检测中真实标注数据获取困难且成本高昂的问题，探索无需真实训练数据的可靠检测方法

Method: 开发了两种范式：1）基于物理声纳模拟生成合成数据训练神经网络；2）基于几何先验的模型模板匹配系统

Result: 在真实波罗的海测深数据上评估：神经网络在模拟场景达到98% mAP，但在真实数据降至40%；模板匹配方法在真实数据达到83% mAP且无需训练

Conclusion: 挑战了水下领域数据密集型深度学习的传统观念，为数据稀缺环境下的水下3D检测建立了首个大规模基准，为自主水下航行器导航等应用开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MobileDenseAttn模型，通过融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流水线，在脑部MRI肿瘤检测中实现了98.35%的测试准确率，同时提供了较强的可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑部肿瘤检测方法存在几大问题：对异质性肿瘤的泛化能力有限、计算效率低、可解释性差以及缺乏透明度，影响了临床信任度。手动分析时长且易出错。

Method: 设计了MobileDenseAttn融合模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流水线优势。采用特征层融合技术，在扩充6020张MRI扫描的数据集上训练，包含贝米肿、脑膜肿、脉坐体肿和正常样本。通过GradCAM提供视觉解释。

Result: 在严格的5折交叉验证下，训练准确率达99.75%，测试准确率达98.35%，F1分数为0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920）。相比基线模型（VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2）准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热力图清晰显示肿瘤医影区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有强大的临床应用潜力，能够成为真实世界中识别脑部肿瘤的实用工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面存在系统性缺陷：当通过视觉而非文本参考实体时，模型的事实回忆能力显著下降，表明模型难以将内部知识实体与图像表示相连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是模型在视觉参考下回忆事实知识能力下降的问题。

Method: 通过控制研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用内部状态模式探测来识别不可靠响应，并在视觉问答任务中应用选择性预测。

Result: 强制VLMs依赖图像表示时，事实回忆能力减半；内部状态探测达到92%以上的准确率来标记不可靠响应；选择性预测使覆盖率提高7.87%，错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探测可有效识别模型失败情况，这为语言基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像重建中的辐射模糊问题，显著提升了3D重建的精度和保真度，可作为现有方法的有效补充和增强。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Motivation: 非法垃圾堆放场对人们和环境造成严重威胁，但手动检测靚苦且耗费时间和资源。深度学习可以自动化这一过程，但缺乏高质量的公开数据集。

Method: 使用AerialWaste数据集（含10434张意大利Lombardy地区的航拍图像），训练多个轻量深度学习模型（Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等），并采用集成学习技术结合性能最佳的模型。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSU框架，通过结构-语义统一方法解决多模态情感分析中的模态结构依赖和语义对齐问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态特定的结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU)框架：1) 动态构建模态特定图结构；2) 引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；3) 采用多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了模型的可解释性和情感模式捕捉能力

Conclusion: SSU框架通过系统整合模态结构信息和跨模态语义对齐，有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能、效率和可解释性

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸重建框架，能够在10毫秒内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3D头像模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅人脸生成方法要么需要逐人优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又能实现实时推理的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计：1）从多视角人脸数据构建3DGS模板模型；2）编码输入图像为身份特定、姿态不变的潜在嵌入；3）解码预测模板高斯参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），运行速度比逐人优化方法快1000倍，同时支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过结合高质量重建和快速推理，扩展了3D高斯泼溅在消费级和交互式系统中照片级真实感头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于人道主义紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect生物特征模板保护方案，在人脸和指纹识别中验证了其有效性、安全性和隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会加剧弱势群体的数据安全风险，需要开发适合此类场景的生物特征模板保护方案。

Method: 通过制定功能、操作和安全隐私需求，比较分析现有BTP方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实人道主义数据集上进行评估，同时扩展到指纹识别。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，是首个在识别场景和指纹生物识别中评估该方法的研究。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有效、模块化且计算轻量的BTP方案，适用于人道主义紧急场景，未来计划发布代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

TL;DR: 论文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图）来解决现有模型在需要实体、角色和时空关系推理任务上的局限性，通过轻量级图推理模块提升细粒度语义保真度、鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式关系推理的任务（如细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析）时存在局限性，这些任务的空间、时间和语义依赖关系对性能至关重要。

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成动态关系图接口，图拓扑和边语义根据输入和任务上下文动态推断，通过轻量级的上下文自适应图推理模块增强基础模型。

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑肿瘤分割等跨领域任务中，增强后的模型相比纯基础模型基线在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面均有提升，同时具有更好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了FM图混合模型的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接测试结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的车牌可读性分类数据集LPLC，包含10,210张车辆图像和12,687个标注车牌，用于判断车牌是否需要超分辨率处理或是否完全不可恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动车牌识别中低质量车牌识别困难的问题，通过选择性图像预处理来优化模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用细粒度标注策略，包括车辆和车牌级别的遮挡、四个可读性类别（完美、良好、差、不可读），并使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种图像识别网络作为基准模型进行分类任务。

Result: 所有三个基线模型的总体F1分数都低于80%，表明该任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，强调了在该领域进行更多研究的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性不足、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，为临床部署提供轻量级可信赖的AI系统。

Method: 采用专家-通才框架：1）轻量级领域训练图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确诊断；2）压缩对话VLM（通才）生成自然语言解释；3）知识图谱检索模块确保回答基于事实知识。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，诊断准确性比最强基线提高18%，平均VRAM需求降低至少20%，延迟降低至少5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通才系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件具有不可预测性和上下文依赖性。传统方法需要大量异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以避免这个问题。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干网络提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架为监控视频分析提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Motivation: 解决3D场景流估计中大规模人工标注数据集的瓶颈问题，当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展

Method: 提出跨模态标签转移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签转移到LiDAR域

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著超越现有自监督方法，仅需10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能

Conclusion: DoGFlow框架有效解决了3D场景流估计的标注瓶颈，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的安全导航提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像中恢复准确的建筑结构，而3D细节化方法又过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如立方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗糙先验到详细几何的转换过程，开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法能够在不增加计算成本的情况下实现灵活的几何控制，成功解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图生成和地图提示设计评估至关重要

Method: 两阶段深度学习流水线：先用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，然后用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排名，采用参数高效的adapter技术

Result: 在5款动作RPG游戏的自建数据集上验证，发现完全微调在充足数据时STP检测更好，而adapter转移在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健有效

Conclusion: 这个新问题的定义、基准流水线和数据集的提供，以及对高效模型适配的初步见解，为未来AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过随机特征重组增加了特征组合的多样性和粒度，充分利用了解耦特征间的信息交互，为多模态癌症生存分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house

effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（如阴影、反射等），通过合成数据和扩散变换器实现高质量的视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜面效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器的视频修复模型；引入额外监督显式预测副作用区域；参考式擦除整个视频。

Result: ROSE在各类副作用移除任务上表现优异，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: 提出的ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用，结合合成数据生成和先进模型架构，为视频对象移除提供了全面解决方案，并建立了新的评估基准ROSE-Bench。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 该论文提出了解决视频字幕生成中运动-细节不平衡问题的方案，包括构建HMD-270K数据集和开发OwlCap模型，通过CSER奖励机制实现运动与细节的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过Motion-Detail Fusion和Fine-Grained Examination两阶段流程构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于Group Relative Policy Optimization提出Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证增强完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap模型在细节导向的VDC基准上Acc提升4.2，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上F1提升4.6，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，推动了视频字幕研究的发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于频域SNR先验的SFormer方法，通过傅里叶注意力机制和频率自适应变换器，在U型架构中结合RGB流和SNR引导分支，显著提升水下图像增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于空间域SNR先验的水下图像增强方法存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构和抑制噪声方面效果有限。

Method: 提出了频域SNR先验方法，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计了傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈；构建了统一的U型架构，整合常规RGB流和SNR引导分支。

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，SFormer相比现有方法获得PSNR 3.1 dB和SSIM 0.08的提升，成功恢复了水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度。

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验方法有效克服了空间域方法的局限性，通过频谱交互和SNR线索的结合，显著提升了水下图像增强的性能。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出分层时空分割网络(Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network)用于超声心动图视频的左心室内膜分割，通过结合局部细节建模和全局动态感知来提高射血分数(EF)估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性。

Method: 采用分层设计：低层级使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层级使用Mamba架构捕获时空关系。提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块，通过跨帧和位置的跳跃扫描整合长距离上下文信息。

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免仅依赖单帧时的局部误差累积或仅使用多帧数据时的细节忽略问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效改善了超声心动图视频中的左心室内膜分割和EF估计精度。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS是一种新的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和可扩展性差的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，通过离线特征提取实现全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一个简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，特别适用于域适应任务，具有显著降低内存和计算成本的优势，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Conclusion: 类别泛满正则化是一种有效的方法，能够在不平衡数据集上同时改善少数类识别和整体泛化性能

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度范数评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得无效，无法有效结合课程学习和SAM的优势

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性，将其集成到基于课程学习的SAM训练中动态评估样本难度

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务上验证，方法同时保持了课程学习和SAM的优势，优于现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦区域有效评估样本难度的方法，成功实现了课程学习与SAM的有效结合，提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡等挑战。某些物种（如扇贝）检测性能较差，但根本原因尚不清楚。研究旨在探索除数据量外影响类别特异性性能差异的因素，以及如何系统改进表现不佳的海洋物种检测。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最具挑战性的阶段，与数据量无关。分类实验显示即使在平衡数据条件下仍存在持续的精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖性的内在特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先考虑精度时使用不平衡分布，在优先考虑召回率时使用平衡分布。改进表现不佳的类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面。研究公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效在音频质量恶化时转向视觉模态，显著提升了音频-视觉语音识别在噪声环境中的性能表现

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的人物交互检测评测标准，将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，以适应生成式视觉语言模型的特性，避免因正确预测与标注不完全匹配而被罚分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HOI检测标准（如HICO-DET）在现代生成式VLM出现前开发，其严格的类别匹配评价方式与VLM的多重合理解释特性不匹配，导致合理预测被错误罚分。

Method: 重构HOI检测为多选题任务，每道题包含真实正确选项和细心构建的负面选项（避免包含合理但未标注的交互行为），支持多重正确答案。

Result: 新标准能够更公平地评估VLM咄专门HOI方法的性能，避免合理预测被罚分的问题，为两种方法提供直接可比的评测平台。

Conclusion: 该新评测协议是首个同时适用于VLM和专门HOI方法的标准，能够更准确地评估HOI理解的当前进展水平。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多选题生成主要关注文本选项，忽略了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项生成成本高、扩展性有限

Method: 采用跨模态选项合成框架，整合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，包含内容识别模块来筛选适合视觉选项的内容

Result: 实验结果表明CmOS在多个学科和教育层级的内容识别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: CmOS框架成功解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量视觉多选题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Result: 首次实现了无需真实地图标注的在线地图模型训练，伪标签可用于大规模无标注数据的半监督预训练

Conclusion: 该方法为在线地图学习提供了新的无监督训练范式，能够利用大规模众包数据提升模型性能

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于字体形状与印象标签关系的新型嵌入方法，通过构建印象标签共现图并进行谱嵌入，在字体生成和检索任务中优于BERT和CLIP等标准词嵌入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的视觉印象，字体形状与描述这些印象的标签之间存在密切关系，但标准词嵌入方法无法有效捕捉这种关系。

Method: 构建印象标签共现图（节点为印象标签，边编码共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法在印象引导的字体生成任务上表现优于BERT和CLIP等标准词嵌入方法。

Conclusion: 利用字体形状与印象标签之间的关系进行嵌入学习，能够更有效地支持基于印象的字体生成和检索应用。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家森林调查需要耗费大量人力进行现场调查，而遥感技术结合机器学习可以更频繁地更新调查数据。当前方法主要依赖手工设计的物候特征，需要更有效的分类方法。

Method: 利用公开的预训练遥感时间序列基础模型，从Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5和SRTM卫星数据中提取时间序列数据，然后使用少量标签数据进行细调。

Result: 在荷兰国家森林调查中，该方法比当前最先进方法准确率提升了10%，证明传统手工设计的调和特征过于简单。

Conclusion: 深度AI特征在数据有限的国家森林调查分类任务中具有巨大潜力，通过利用公开卫星数据和预训练模型可以显著提高分类准确性，有效补充现有森林调查过程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

solution demonstrates the effectiveness of modern convolutional architectures
for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

Motivation: 现有微表情分析方法主要依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉复杂的时序动态。虽然近期采用了视频级回归框架，但区间解码仍依赖手动预定义的基于窗口的方法，问题仅得到部分缓解

Method: 提出先验引导的视频级回归方法，包含可扩展区间选择策略（综合考虑微表情的时序演化、持续时间和类别分布特征）和协同优化框架（定位和识别任务共享参数，仅分类头不同）

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确识别微表情的起始、顶点和偏移阶段，充分利用互补信息，高效利用有限数据，并增强模型能力

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法使得现代稳定器能够超越长期以来的SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似于经典方法的控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的跨模态公平性问题，为公平医疗AI提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，因此需要分别增强对象和交互查询

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型能以对象感知方式关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能

Conclusion: 提出的双查询增强网络通过分别增强对象和交互查询，有效提升了HOI检测的性能，证明了查询增强策略的有效性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像描述和检索任务主要关注人物、物体和场景的表层识别，往往忽略定义真实世界事件的上下文和语义维度

Method: 基于OpenEvents V1数据集，整合上下文、时间和语义信息来捕捉图像背后的who、when、where、what、why，通过公开和私有测试阶段进行评估

Result: 来自6个国家的45支团队参与，前三名团队在ACM Multimedia 2025展示解决方案

Conclusion: EVENTA为上下文感知、叙事驱动的多媒体AI奠定了基础，在新闻、媒体分析、文化存档和可访问性等领域有应用前景

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于Transformer的群体与单人行人分类框架，通过空间利用和行为模式指标分析差异，为人群动力学研究建立基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分群体和单人行人，分析他们在空间利用和行为模式上的差异，为行人模拟和空间设计验证提供理论基础。

Method: 将行人轨迹分割为固定时间窗口，使用Transformer模型进行配对分类，结合凸包面积、最小包围圆半径、热力图空间密度等空间指标，以及速度变化、运动角度偏差等行为指标。

Result: 建立了完整的分类管道和数据集结构，能够识别凝聚群体和孤立单人，为不同序列长度（60、100、200帧）的可扩展分析奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为后续定量分析和人群动力学研究提供了重要基础，未来版本将完成完整指标分析及其在行人模拟和空间设计验证中的应用。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

TL;DR: 一种多尺度弱监督语义分割框架，通过将水下影像的细层级生态信息转移到航拍数据，实现了基于无人机影像的大规模玫琥礁分类分割，减少了手动标注的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测玫琥礁需要大范围空间覆盖，但航拍影像分辨率有限难以区分细层级玫琥礁类型，而获取像素级标注成本高、劳动密集，限制了深度学习方法的可扩展性。

Method: 提出多尺度弱监督语义分割框架，结合分类基础的监督、空间插值和自我蓬汁技术，将水下影像的细层级生态信息转移到航拍数据。

Result: 方法能够在最小化手动标注的情况下实现大面积玫琥礁形态分类分割，并显示了集成新类别的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种可扩展、成本效益高的高分辨率玫琥礁监测方法，结合低成本数据采集、弱监督深度学习和多尺度遥感技术。

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Motivation: 传统GIS制图需要专业知识且耗时，生成式AI为自动化制图提供了新机会，但现有模型在地图生成的空间布局和语义控制方面存在不足。

Method: 整合矢量数据来引导不同风格的地图生成，通过文本提示指定风格，并开发了网页应用来提高可用性和可访问性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了AI辅助制图的新范式，同时指出了进一步技术改进的方向和制图专家在AI时代的新角色。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available

TL;DR: USO提出了一个统一的风格-主体优化定制模型，通过解耦学习和风格奖励学习，在风格相似性和主体一致性方面都达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动的生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显的对抗性。作者认为这两个目标可以在单一框架下统一，因为它们都涉及内容和风格的解耦与重组。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 采用风格奖励学习范式(SRL)进一步提升性能；4) 发布USO-Bench基准测试。

Result: 大量实验表明，USO在开源模型中在主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: USO成功地将风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务统一到一个框架中，通过内容和风格的解耦与重组，在两个目标上都取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估NeRF隐私保护能力的新协议，并开发了ppNeSF方法，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保护隐私的同时实现准确的视觉定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于NeRF的视觉定位方法虽然能提供高质量的新视角合成，但会无意中编码精细场景细节，在云服务部署时存在隐私泄露风险。

Method: 提出隐私保护评估协议，并开发ppNeRF方法：使用自监督学习的分割标签替代RGB图像进行训练，确保标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时保持3D区分性。

Result: 实验表明传统NeRF的几何表示容易受到隐私攻击，而ppNeSF方法在保护隐私的同时实现了最先进的视觉定位精度。

Conclusion: ppNeSF通过分割监督训练有效解决了NeRF的隐私问题，为隐私保护的视觉定位提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本检索和纯视觉检索两种方式，在多个多页文档数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面（内存消耗大），要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，内存需求高。RAG提供了一种通过检索相关片段再生成答案的替代方案。

Method: 采用两种检索变体：基于OCR文本的检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索，在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行系统评估。

Result: 文本检索变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体无需文本提取也能实现+5.0 ANLS提升。检索和重排序组件是主要贡献因素。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了其在真实应用中的实用价值，而布局引导的分块策略在这些数据集上效果不佳。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估方法来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，并设计了GRAS偏见评分这一可解释的量化指标，对五个最先进的视觉语言模型进行了评估。

Result: 测试结果显示所有模型都存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），同时发现评估视觉问答偏见时需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了当前视觉语言模型中普遍存在的人口统计偏见问题，强调了在模型评估中考虑多种问题表述的重要性，为偏见检测和缓解提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，一种基于transformer的端到端屋顶平面分割方法，通过边缘感知模块和几何约束解决当前深度学习方法在边缘精度和几何特征利用不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：1）非真正端到端导致分割结果非最优；2）边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确；3）平面几何特征考虑不足。需要开发真正端到端且能提升边缘精度的分割方法

Method: 提出RoofSeg网络，采用transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询分层预测平面实例掩码。设计边缘感知掩码模块（EAMM）融入平面几何先验增强边缘判别性，提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失约束网络训练

Result: 开发了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割网络，通过边缘感知模块提升了边缘区域的分割精度，几何约束损失提高了网络训练的稳定性

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，实现了更高精度的端到端分割，特别在边缘区域有显著改进

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: 提出MicroDetect-Net模型，结合荧光显微镜、尼罗红染色和深度学习，在血液样本中检测微塑料，准确率达92%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染日益严重，每年塑料产量超过3.68亿吨，微塑料已存在于空气、水、土壤和生物体中，对人体健康造成肝脏感染、肠道损伤等危害，需要有效的检测方法

Method: 使用尼罗红染料染色和荧光显微镜技术，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割，开发MicroDetect-Net模型来定位和计数血液样本中的微塑料碎片

Result: 在276张尼罗红染色荧光血液图像数据集上评估，达到92%准确率，IoU为87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精确率90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测方面表现出色，虽然使用蛤血样本有局限性，但为应用于更一致的人类样本提供了初步数据收集的方法

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出Prompt Pyramid结构组织多粒度事件提示，并构建Ancestor-Descendant Interaction机制实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著超越先前模型。

Conclusion: ProPy成功将CLIP适配到PRVR任务，通过多粒度事件语义建模取得了优异效果。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型的大规模数据集，通过计算热内核签名作为自监督目标，学习几何表征表示，并应用于小规模临床试验的冠状动脉壳剪应力分割

Result: 学习到的几何表征表示能够在有限数据下显著提升冠状动脉低、中、高壳剪应力区域的分割性能

Conclusion: 自监督预训练模型可以有效利用大规模几何数据集来提升小规模临床数据的血流动力学标记物评估效果

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单像素成像通过结构化光模式顺序照明实现单探测器物体重建，但需要优化任务特定的二进制照明模式以提高重建性能

Method: 使用直通估计器解决二进制模式优化的不可微问题，在双层公式中利用总深度变分正则化器

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过振动激励来维持事件相机持续事件生成的轻量级方法，结合运动补偿管道消除注入的运动，为下游感知任务提供干净的运动校正事件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机在静态或低运动场景下无法生成事件的问题，避免使用复杂硬件或额外光学组件

Method: 使用简单的旋转不平衡质量块产生周期性振动运动来诱导事件生成，并开发运动补偿管道来去除注入的运动

Result: 硬件原型验证表明方法能可靠恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测方面优于无运动诱导的事件传感

Conclusion: 该方法为事件相机在静态场景中的应用提供了简单有效的解决方案，显著提升了感知性能

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的少样本学习方法，通过结合UNet++网络结构和拓扑感知损失函数，在仅需3个注释页面的情况下实现了历史文档文本行分割的高精度自动化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而这些数据获取成本高且需要专业知识，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++网络结构，结合一种为神经元形态开发的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚线段碎片化和意外合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取3个注释页面中提取小块进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了当前最佳方法：识别准确率提高了200%，行交并比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛胜利者的F-Measure分数。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的网络结构与拓扑感知损失函数的结合，在极少注释数据的情况下实现了高效的历史文档文本行分割，为少样本学习领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种简单有效的方法来增强单目3D视觉定位任务中的3D感知能力，通过改进文本嵌入和几何特征处理，在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得了11.94%的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目3D视觉定位方法中，文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略了测量单位，导致预训练语言模型的3D理解能力较弱，产生误导性的文本特征阻碍3D感知。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 3D文本增强(3DTE)，通过增加文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来增强不同单位间映射关系的理解；2) 文本引导几何增强(TGE)模块，将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，利用3D增强的文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比之前的方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征处理，有效解决了文本嵌入对测量单位不敏感的问题，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码方法(WEF-PE)，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和几何特性来更好地编码图像空间结构，在多个视觉任务上取得了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用一维位置编码会破坏图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性与视觉数据中的平移不变性模式相匹配，通过非线性几何特性自然编码空间距离关系，并利用代数加法公式直接从绝对编码推导任意补丁对之间的相对位置信息。

Result: 在多个实验场景中取得优越性能：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%准确率，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示相比传统方法具有更强的几何归纳偏置和更连贯的语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE提供了一种数学原理严谨的方法来直接处理二维坐标，通过椭圆函数的自然几何特性有效编码空间关系，为Vision Transformer提供了更好的空间结构建模能力，源代码已在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有的网格生成方法通过序列化三角网格会导致顶点重复使用，产生过长的代序序列和效率低下的生成过程

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点，然后用双向Transformer捕捉顶点关系并构建邻接矩阵来完成面的生成，添加保真增强器精细顶点位置和后处理框架清除不良边缘连接

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离顶点和面的生成策略，有效解决了网格生成中的重复性问题，在保持高质量的同时大幅提升了生成效率

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

TL;DR: 提出了All-in-One Slider方法，通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，实现单一轻量模块控制多种图像属性，支持零样本操作和属性组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型在渐进式属性操控方面存在挑战，特别是针对人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法需要为每个属性训练独立滑块，导致参数冗余且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 训练轻量级模块将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，形成通用滑块，支持细粒度连续控制和属性重组。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，相比之前方法有显著改进，并能扩展到真实图像处理。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider提供了解释性强、灵活度高的属性操控方案，支持零样本操作和多属性组合，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Conclusion: 该框架通过语义指导和多模态融合技术，成功生成了与角色、场景和语言内容深度一致的连贯动作，超越了简单的节奏同步，实现了更具表现力的角色动画生成。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了纳米尺度运动测量的实验挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管(CNTs)是纳米技术的关键构建块，但其动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜(SEM)成像中纳米尺度运动测量的实验挑战限制。现有方法只能提供静态分析，而原位技术通常需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的逐粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack框架集成了手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器，在粒子跟踪框架内实现CNT微柱生长的运动学分析。通过13,540条手动注释轨迹的系统性评估，确定了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最佳组合。

Result: VFTrack实现了F1分数0.78和α分数0.89的优异性能。运动向量可分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，有助于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化的CNT柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了CNT合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster

*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个4D风格化基准测试套件Style4D-Bench，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集，并基于4D高斯溅射构建了Style4D框架，在时空一致性和多视角一致性方面达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和方法，需要建立统一的评估标准和推动该领域的发展。

Method: 基于4D高斯溅射构建Style4D框架，包含三个核心组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（轻量级MLP）、整体几何保持风格迁移模块（对比一致性学习和结构内容保持）。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的大量实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面达到了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度风格细节并保持稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的重要资源，有助于基准测试和推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过图像生成和姿态优化两个步骤，使用自注意力重连机制和关键点对应来实现精确的姿态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型取得了进展，但通过语言控制来精确调整3D资产姿态仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。现有的方法在这方面存在局限性，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 分解问题为两个步骤：修改图像生成器创建目标图像，然后通过多视角姿态优化对齐网格
2. 引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)来解耦源结构和姿态
3. 使用关键点建立输入图像和目标图像之间的对应关系，而不是依赖可微分渲染

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现出色，成功操纵姿态同时保持网格的原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言指令精确控制3D资产的姿态，在保持结构一致性的同时实现了高质量的姿态调整。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的3D局部编辑方法，通过在3D潜在空间中保留未编辑区域的上下文特征，实现精确且连贯的3D编辑效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的完整性和整体一致性，需要更精确的3D局部编辑技术

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹获取反转潜在表示和键值令牌，然后在去噪编辑阶段用这些缓存特征替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的一致性重建

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了有效解决方案，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，将自然语言查询转换为查询计划，避免SQL的限制，支持复杂数据分析功能和大规模数据集处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模表格化数据集查询分析的挑战，特别是对于缺乏SQL编程知识的用户。小文本到SQL方法存在效率低下和复杂分析功能支持不足的问题。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLMs）迭代解释查询并构建操作序列，逐步构建解决方案。在数据库外部实现，直接在数据上执行操作，避免上下文长度限制。

Result: 通过在标准数据库和大规模科学表格上的实验验证，证明了该框架在处理大规模数据集和执行复杂数据分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了比传统SQL更灵活和可扩展的数据查询分析能力，能够支持主成分分析、异常检测等复杂分析功能，为大规模数据集查询分析提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个联邦学习框架，用于分割缺血性中风病变，通过共享深度中心独立表示知识，在14个医疗中心的2031个研究中实现了优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因和第三大致残原因，临床指南将DWI作为标准诊断工具，但病变分析存在高度变异性。现有计算方法通常只从单一机构学习，缺乏泛化能力，且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 开发了一个协作框架，通过联邦平均（FedAvg）算法共享来自不同医疗中心的深度中心独立表示知识，用于分割DWI序列中的缺血性中风病变。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上取得了DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26的总体性能，优于集中式和其他联邦学习规则。模型表现出强大的泛化性能，在不同病变类别中表现一致，在分布外中心也表现可靠（DSC 0.64±0.29，AVD 4.44±8.74，无需额外训练）。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习框架成功解决了多中心中风病变分割中的泛化问题，通过知识共享实现了优异的性能，为临床实践提供了可靠的计算支持工具。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Conclusion: 通过整合视网膜层结构信息和测试时适应策略，有效提升了弱监督黄斑水肿分割的性能，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Method: 建立统一基准，比较7种分割方法（包括一阶段和两阶段方法），在两个包含多线圈k空间数据和人工标注分割真值的MRI数据集上进行测试。

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂专门方法。

Conclusion: 数据一致性在加速MRI分割中至关重要，简单的两阶段方法比复杂的一阶段方法更有效，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在传感器RAW数据上进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后色调处理模块，解决了传统sRGB域扩散模型的高保真度与真实感之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景（如边缘设备图像采集）中的可访问性，导致性能不佳。RDDM旨在通过直接在RAW域恢复图像来突破这一限制。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习最优潜在表示；设计可微分后色调处理（PTP）模块实现RAW和sRGB空间的联合优化；开发可扩展的退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对；设计可配置多拜耳（CMB）LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，能够以更少的伪影产生更高保真度的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域操作，成功解决了传统方法在高保真度和真实感之间的权衡问题，为图像恢复提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Motivation: 解决transformer模型在分布外(OOD)数据上分割性能下降的问题，提高癌症CT扫描分割的可靠性

Method: 使用Swin Transformer编码器（通过SimMIM在10,432个未标记3D CT扫描上预训练）和卷积解码器，结合随机森林分类器利用深度特征检测OOD扫描

Result: 在603个3D CT测试数据上，RF-Deep在肺栓塞、COVID-19和腹部CT上的FPR95分别为18.26%、27.66%和小于0.1%，优于现有OOD方法

Conclusion: RF-Deep分类器提供了一种简单有效的方法，可在分布内和分布外场景中增强癌症分割的可靠性

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练Transformer模型规模增大和部署广泛，其在输入扰动下的鲁棒性成为紧迫问题。现有方法在小参数和大规模模型之间存在差异，且通常依赖劳动密集型的样本特定对抗设计。

Method: 提出统一的局部鲁棒性框架SALMAN，核心是新颖的Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD)度量，通过比较输入到输出的距离映射来评估样本敏感性，具有近线性复杂度。

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得了显著提升，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架作为实用的模型无关工具，可提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE模型的稀疏性对记忆和推理能力有不同影响：记忆性能随总参数增加而提升，但推理性能会饱和甚至下降，且无法通过后训练或额外计算来补救。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE模型已成为先进系统的标准配置，但其稀疏维度对模型能力的影响尚未被充分研究，特别是对记忆和推理两种不同能力体系的影响。

Method: 训练了多个MoE Transformer模型家族，系统性地改变总参数、激活参数和top-k路由策略，同时保持计算预算不变，记录预训练损失、下游任务损失和任务准确率。

Result: 记忆基准测试随总参数增加单调改善，与训练损失一致；而推理性能会饱和甚至下降，尽管总参数和训练损失持续改善。改变top-k路由对性能影响很小，传统超参数对泛化差距的调节方向与稀疏性相同。

Conclusion: MoE稀疏性对记忆和推理能力产生不同影响，推理性能存在上限，过度稀疏的模型无法通过后训练强化学习或额外测试时计算来补救推理缺陷。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

TL;DR: 统一框架结合统计物理、编码理论和代数拓扑学，通过在Nishimori温度下运行随机铅伊艺模型，实现高效多类图像分类。通过拓扑学指导的图设计，将1280维特征压缩到32-64维，在ImageNet子集上达到独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将统计物理、编码理论和代数拓扑学结合，为高效多类图像分类提供一个统一的理论框架，通过理论指导的图设计实现特征压缩和性能优化。

Method: 将高维特征向量解释为疏密MET-QC-LDPC图上的旋旋，构成随机铅伊艺模型。在Nishimori温度下运行，使得Bethe-Hessian矩阵的最小特征值消失。通过二次插值和牛顿纠正高效估计温度，设计球面和周面图集来压制有害损失集。

Result: 在ImageNet-10上达到98.7%的准确率，在ImageNet-100上达到82.7%的准确率。将特征从1280维压缩到32-64维（压缩比40倍），但仍保持独创性能。温度估计速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 拓扑学指导的图设计能够产生高效的、受物理启发的嵌入表示，在大规模特征压缩后仍能达到独创的性能水平。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWiFT是一种高效的机器学习去偏框架，通过软掩码权重微调技术，只需少量外部数据和几个训练周期即可减少模型偏见，同时保持诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法需要原始训练数据和大量重新训练，且在模型公平性和性能之间存在权衡。医疗等敏感领域需要更高效、低成本的去偏解决方案。

Method: 首先识别模型参数对偏见和预测性能的相对贡献，然后采用两步微调过程，根据参数贡献度定义不同的梯度流来更新每个参数。

Result: 在四个皮肤病和两个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，SWiFT能持续减少模型偏见，在公平性和准确性指标上达到或超越现有技术，并在多个分布外数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效、低成本的去偏解决方案，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著改善公平性，特别适用于医疗等敏感领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-Flat是一种针对持续学习的平坦损失景观优化方法，通过促进更平坦的最小值来提高模型鲁棒性和性能，并提供高效的C-Flat++变体


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，平衡对新任务的敏感性和对过去知识的稳定性至关重要。现有方法仅依赖零阶锐度可能在某些情况下偏好更尖锐的最小值，导致次优解

Method: 提出C-Flat方法，专门为持续学习设计以促进更平坦的损失景观。该方法具有即插即用兼容性，可轻松集成到现有代码流程中。还提出了C-Flat++，通过选择性平坦度驱动提升来显著降低更新成本

Conclusion: C-Flat和C-Flat++为持续学习提供了有效的平坦度优化解决方案，能够改善模型鲁棒性和学习效率，具有广泛的适用性和实用性

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Min-Chun Chen,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文首次研究LLM推荐系统中的成员推理攻击风险，设计了四种攻击方法并在真实数据集上验证了其有效性，发现直接询问和投毒攻击具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的推荐系统使用包含用户敏感历史交互信息的提示词进行上下文学习，这些隐私信息可能面临新型隐私攻击，但此前缺乏相关研究。

Method: 设计了四种成员推理攻击方法：直接询问攻击、幻觉攻击、相似性攻击和投毒攻击，每种方法都利用了LLM或推荐系统的独特特性。在三个LLM模型和两个推荐系统基准数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 实验证实LLM推荐系统确实存在成员推理攻击威胁，其中直接询问攻击和投毒攻击表现出显著高的攻击优势。分析了影响攻击效果的因素，如提示词中的样本数量和受害者位置。

Conclusion: LLM推荐系统存在严重的隐私泄露风险，需要开发相应的防御机制来保护用户的历史交互数据隐私。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合传递熵和定向持续同调学的拓扑框架，用于分析神经时间序列中的信息流，可识别复杂任务、刺激结构和行为状态的区别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注成对连接性，难以捕捉神经系统中超越成对连接的高维交互模式和多尺度组织结构。需要一种能够量化定向信息流并映射到全局组织模式的原理性方法。

Method: 使用传递熵(TE)量化神经元间的定向影响，生成加权有向图；然后应用定向持续同调学(PH)分析这些图，评估多结构尺度和维度的拓扑复杂性。

Result: 在合成脉冲网络、图像分类网络和小鼠皮层记录中，该方法成功区分了任务复杂性、刺激结构和行为状态。复杂或噪声条件下高维特征更加显著，反映了超越成对连接性的交互模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为将定向信息流映射到人工和生物神经系统的全局组织模式提供了原理性方法，具有通用性和可解释性，特别适用于时间分辨的二进制脉冲数据。

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

TL;DR: 通过实验评估了光学透明增强现实系统中目标透明度和工具可视化方式对深度感知的影响，发现不透明目标和实时遮捏处理能显著提升精确度和用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学透明增强现实系统在手术等臂长式应用中存在深度感知和实际工具遮捏问题，需要研究不同可视化方案对性能的影响

Method: 在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验：实验1比较高低透明度目标渲染的深度匹配误差；实验2在6种可视化条件下进行手术任务，收集深度误差、定位误差、系统易用性等数据

Result: 不透明目标深度估计误差显著低于高透明度目标；显示实际工具（遮捏虚拟目标）获得最高精度和最佳用户体验，而不进行工具跟踪的效果最差

Conclusion: 正确的遮捏线索、将虚拟内容渲染为不透明并实时被实际工具遮捏对于OST-AR系统的深度感知和精度至关重要

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

Motivation: 解决跨学科团队（光学、算法、硬件加速计算、生命科学）在复杂成像系统设计中存在的沟通障碍和需求对齐问题，减少因误解导致的成本浪费。

Method: 采用第五代声明式问题表述语言(5GL)，将项目需求从硬件约束到生命科学需求形式化为机器可读的问题陈述，通过96-Eyes多相机并行多模态成像器项目进行实践验证。

Result: 声明式方法增强了设计透明度，确保了可追溯性，最小化了跨团队的成本失调，有效保留了来自不同领域利益相关者的关键任务输入。

Conclusion: 声明式问题表述能够促进并发研发工作流环境中的创新，但需要克服在命令式第三代语言(3GL)主导的环境中采用5GL的实际障碍，编程范式通过现有领域层次结构隐式地塑造研究工作流。

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

Motivation: 电磁信号在频谱管理、智能交通等领域至关重要，但由于信号异质性高、背景噪声强、时频结构复杂，现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化能力和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集；开发长度自适应多信号打包方法；采用硬件感知训练策略；利用电磁信号物理特性进行表示学习。

Conclusion: EMind通过基础模型方法有效解决了电磁信号处理的根本挑战，为电磁智能提供了统一框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Conclusion: H-PRM为ASR热词定制领域展示了新的研究方向，通过插入式的预检索模块有效解决了大规模热词识别的挑战。

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble

density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using

generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观质量（文学性、情感表达）和客观约束（格式要求、字数限制），单奖励策略无法同时提升两种能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性

Method: 提出RLMR（混合奖励强化学习），使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行自动和人工评估，构建真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循能力（IFEval）从83.36%提升到86.65%，写作质量在WriteEval人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Motivation: 当前LLM评估框架存在碎片化问题，过分关注技术指标而忽视了部署所需的整体评估，导致基准测试性能与现实效用之间存在脱节。

Method: 提出三维分类法：IQ（通用智能基础能力）、EQ（价值对齐交互能力）、PQ（专业领域专长能力），并构建价值导向评估框架，整合经济、社会、伦理、环境等维度。

Result: 分析了200多个基准测试，识别出动态评估需求和可解释性差距等关键挑战，建立了开源评估资源库。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发技术熟练、情境相关且伦理健全的LLM提供了可操作的指导，弥合了基准测试与现实应用之间的差距。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

Result: 实验结果显示相比基线朴素检索策略，偏置减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效促进公平平衡的知识传播，在保持信息相关性的同时显著降低偏置

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

TL;DR: CAC-CoT是一种使用有限连接词短语的紧凑思维链方法，在保持System-1任务性能的同时，显著缩短推理长度并提升System-2任务表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长思维链会降低LLM在快速直觉性System-1任务上的性能，需要一种既能保持准确性又能提高效率的紧凑推理方法

Method: 引入Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，限制推理使用少量固定连接词短语，引导模型生成简洁结构化解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%性能；推理长度平均约300词，比基线缩短三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT通过结构化紧凑推理实现了效率与准确性的平衡，为LLM推理优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化的系统转向创建能够持续学习的开放智能体，因此需要开发能够通过真实世界交互实现持续成长的自进化智能体框架。

Method: 提出ELL框架，基于四个核心原则构建自进化智能体：1）经验探索 - 通过与环境交互生成经验轨迹；2）长期记忆 - 构建持久记忆系统存储历史知识；3）技能学习 - 从经验中抽象可重用技能；4）知识内化 - 将显性经验转化为隐性能力。同时开发StuLife基准数据集模拟大学生活场景。

Conclusion: ELL框架为构建持续学习的开放智能体提供了系统方法，StuLife数据集为评估记忆保持、技能迁移和自激励行为等终身学习能力提供了有效工具，同时探索了上下文工程在推进AGI中的作用。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

<details>

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两大问题：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集监督微调限制了泛化能力。需要将逐步奖励建模从分类任务重新定义为推理任务

Method: 提出生成式判断模型StepWiser，通过强化学习训练，让模型对策略模型的推理步骤进行元推理，先输出思考标记再给出最终判断

Result: StepWiser在中间步骤判断准确性上优于现有方法，可用于改进策略模型训练，并提升推理时搜索效果

Conclusion: 将逐步奖励建模重构为推理任务的方法有效，生成式判断模型在多个维度上优于传统分类方法

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

<details>

Motivation: 现有开放集TTA方法依赖源模型过滤，在域偏移测试数据上过滤效果不佳；而适应模型在噪声测试流中学习时不稳定，用于过滤会导致误差累积

Method: PAF（主辅助过滤）：使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器筛选的数据；KIP（知识集成预测）：整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识进行校准输出

Result: 在多种闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集准确率和开放集判别能力方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集TTA中的过滤不准确和知识整合问题，提高了模型在真实域偏移场景下的性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

*Anders Mølmen Høst,Pierre Lison,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRIAGE是一个使用大型语言模型自动将CVE漏洞映射到ATT&CK技术的混合方法，结合基于规则推理和数据驱动推断，提高了漏洞影响分析的效率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞数据库缺乏漏洞实际影响信息，手动将CVE映射到ATT&CK技术耗时且困难，需要自动化支持来处理大量新漏洞。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先基于MITRE映射方法提示LLM预测技术列表，然后结合第二个使用上下文学习的LLM模块结果，形成混合方法。

Result: 上下文学习优于单独映射方法，混合方法提高了利用技术的召回率，GPT-4o-mini在此任务上表现优于Llama3.3-70B。

Conclusion: LLM可用于自动预测网络安全漏洞的影响，TRIAGE使CVE到ATT&CK的映射过程更加高效。

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.
  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language

TL;DR: UniC-RAG是一种针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的通用知识污染攻击方法，通过优化少量对抗文本同时攻击大量不同主题的用户查询，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统容易受到知识污染攻击，但现有研究主要针对特定查询或相似主题的查询进行攻击，缺乏能够同时攻击大量多样化查询的通用攻击方法。

Method: 将UniC-RAG建模为优化问题，设计包括平衡相似性聚类方法在内的有效解决方案，通过注入少量对抗文本来同时攻击大量用户查询。

Result: 在包含数百万文本的知识库中注入100个对抗文本，可同时攻击2000个用户查询，攻击成功率超过90%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UniC-RAG攻击效果显著，现有防御措施不足以抵御此类攻击，突显了RAG系统需要新的防御机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

Motivation: 传统签名式IDS需要频繁更新规则来应对不断演变的网络威胁，但规则更新过程耗时且延迟部署，影响整体安全准备状态。

Method: 开发FALCON自主代理框架，利用大语言模型(LLMs)从CTI数据实时生成IDS规则，并采用内置多阶段验证器进行评估，支持网络型(Snort)和主机型(YARA)两种检测媒介。

Result: FALCON在自动规则生成方面表现优异，平均准确率达到95%，多位网络安全分析师的定性评估显示84%的评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的数据挖掘在实时网络威胁缓解方面具有可行性和有效性，FALCON框架展示了自主IDS规则生成的潜力。

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型(LLMs)在多大程度上可以利用差分隐私文本消毒过程中产生的上下文漏洞，因为现有的词级DP文本消毒方法存在留下原始文本上下文线索的问题。

Method: 使用先进的LLMs测试更广泛的消毒机制在不同隐私级别下的效果，通过实验分析LLM基于数据重建攻击对隐私和效用的双重影响。

Result: 实验发现LLMs确实能够推断原始语义，有时会降低经验隐私保护，但同时也能用于改善DP消毒文本的质量和隐私性。

Conclusion: 建议将LLM数据重建作为后处理步骤，通过对抗性思维来增强隐私保护，实现隐私保护和文本效用的平衡。

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

TL;DR: Hidden Tail是一种针对视觉语言模型的隐蔽资源消耗攻击，通过生成对抗图像诱导模型输出最大长度的隐藏特殊标记，在保持攻击隐蔽性的同时显著增加推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM资源消耗攻击在延长输出序列时会产生不相关的异常内容，破坏了攻击的隐蔽性，需要在有效性和隐蔽性之间进行权衡

Method: 使用复合损失函数平衡语义保持、重复特殊标记诱导和抑制结束标记，通过动态权重策略优化生成提示无关的对抗图像

Result: 实验显示Hidden Tail将输出长度提升达19.2倍，达到最大标记限制，同时保持攻击隐蔽性

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了VLM在效率导向对抗威胁下的脆弱性，迫切需要提高模型的鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

*Eleni Tselepi,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 首个单次训练的动作混合框架，通过时间条件和骨架感知归一化机制，实现了无需重新训练的平滑、可控动作混合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单次训练模型无法在单次生成过程中显式控制多个动作的混合，需要一个可控框架来实现平滑的动作迁移

Method: 使用时间条件生成过程，引入骨架感知归一化机制来指导不同动作之间的迁移，实现数据驱动的混合控制

Result: 在多种动画风格咄不同动力学骨架上进行了广泛评估，证明方法能够产生合理、平滑且可控的动作混合效果

Conclusion: 该框架为动画师提供了一种统一、高效的方式，在不需要额外数据或重新训练的情况下实现可控的动作变体生成

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

TL;DR: SemLayoutDiff是一个统一的3D室内场景合成模型，通过结合语义地图和扩散模型，能够基于房间掩码约束生成多样化的家具布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效考虑建筑约束条件，需要一种能够显式基于房间结构生成实用且不遮挡的家具布局的3D场景合成方法。

Method: 使用分类扩散模型生成连贯的语义地图，然后通过基于交叉注意力的网络预测家具位置，同时考虑门窗等建筑元素。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成空间连贯、真实且多样化的场景，性能优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff提供了一个有效的框架，能够基于建筑约束生成实用且美观的3D室内场景布局。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

TL;DR: 通过知识蓄粉和预训练生成式模型，PanoHair能够在5秒内生成高保真的头发纹理网格，避免了复杂的多视角数据采集设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有头发纹理生成方法需要复杂的多视图数据采集设备，而且计算时间较长，效率低下。需要一种更高效的方法来生成高保真的头发纹理。

Result: PanoHair能够在5秒内生成清洁的流形头发网格，同时产生语义和方向地图。实验结果显示该方法在效率和质量上都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanoHair提供了一种高效的头发纹理生成方案，避免了复杂的多视角数据采集过程，能够快速生成高保真的头发模型，为创建真实数字人物提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文针对INPC表示提出了多项优化技术，包括改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、CNN预训练以及高斯点建模，显著提升了训练和推理性能而不损失视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INPC虽然在新视角合成中实现了最先进的图像质量，但由于渲染过程中需要查询神经网络，其实际应用受到较慢渲染速度的限制

Method: 改进光栅化器实现、采用更有效的采样技术、为补洞CNN引入预训练、在推理时将点建模为小高斯分布

Result: 优化后的INPC管道实现了训练速度提升25%、渲染速度提升2倍、VRAM使用减少20%，同时图像质量还有轻微提升

Conclusion: 所提出的优化技术不仅适用于INPC，还具有广泛的适用性，在保持视觉保真度的同时显著提升了性能

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨ASR和相关语音语言技术如何概念化和操作化公平性、偏见和公平问题，特别关注非裔美国英语使用者和其他语言多样性群体，识别现有研究的不足并提出改进方向。

Method: 采用范围综述方法，分析了44篇来自人机交互、机器学习/自然语言处理和社会语言学领域的同行评审文献，识别了四个主要研究领域：ASR相关危害理解、包容性数据实践、语言包容性方法理论、以及公平系统设计实践。

Result: 研究发现技术公平干预措施正在增长，但存在关键差距：缺乏以治理为中心的方法，这些方法应强调社区代理、语言正义和参与式问责。识别了四个主要研究领域和现有研究的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了以治理为中心的ASR生命周期作为新兴的跨学科框架，用于负责任的ASR开发，并为研究人员、从业者和政策制定者提供了解决语音AI系统中语言边缘化问题的启示。

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频的机器人执行失败检测方法，利用动作信息和任务相关物体的时空知识，在三个数据集上验证了有效性，并通过数据增强方法将F1分数从77.9提升到81.4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有失败检测方法在现实场景中性能有限，需要更可靠的执行失败检测来触发安全操作模式、恢复策略或任务重规划。

Method: 使用视频分析方法，结合机器人执行的动作和视野中任务相关物体的时空信息，提出可变帧率的数据增强方法。

Result: 在ARMBench数据集上F1分数从77.9提升到80.0（无额外计算开销），通过测试时增强进一步提升到81.4。

Conclusion: 时空信息对失败检测至关重要，建议未来研究进一步探索合适的启发式方法。

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code
and annotations are available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了切线相交导航(TIG)算法，为无人机在静态和动态环境中提供高效、安全的路径规划方案，在计算效率和路径优度方面都显著优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在战斗支持、包裹投递、搜救营救等应用中需要高效安全的导航能力，而现有路径规划算法在计算效率、路径平滑性和实时避障能力方面仍有提升空间。

Method: 算法采用椭圆切线相交方法生成可行路径，为每个威胁生成两条子路径，根据质量评估选择最优路线，逐步精炼至目标。考虑到无人机动力学约束，采用基于二次Bézier曲线的修改平滑技术生成平滑高效路径。

Result: 实验结果显示，TIG算法在静态环境中比A*、PRM、RRT*、切线图和Static APPATT算法更快(从0.01秒开始)生成最短路径，转弯角更少。在未知和部分知晚环境中，TIG在实时避偶路径规划方面表现优于APF和Dynamic APPATT算法。

Conclusion: TIG算法为无人机提供了一种高效、可靠的路径规划方案，在各种环境下都显示出优异的性能，对于推动无人机应用的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art
methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

TL;DR: MemoryVLA是一个受人类记忆机制启发的机器人操作框架，通过工作记忆和长期记忆系统处理时序上下文，在长时程任务中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流VLA模型忽略时序上下文，难以处理长时程、时序依赖的任务。受人类工作记忆和海马体系统的启发，需要开发能够有效利用时序信息的机器人操作框架

Method: 提出Cognition-Memory-Action框架：预训练VLM编码观测为感知和认知token形成工作记忆，感知-认知记忆库存储低层细节和高层语义，工作记忆从库中检索相关条目并与当前token融合，记忆条件扩散动作专家生成时序感知动作序列

Result: 在三个仿真测试套件上分别达到71.9%、72.7%和96.5%的成功率，均优于CogACT和pi-0等基线方法，在Bridge任务上提升14.6%。在12个真实世界任务中达到84.0%成功率，长时程任务相比基线提升26%

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制有效解决了机器人操作中的时序上下文问题，在仿真和真实环境中都表现出色，为长时程时序依赖任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:
