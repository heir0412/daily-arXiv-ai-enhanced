### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiStream-LLM是一个模块化的手语翻译框架，通过分离专门的手指拼写、唇读和连续手语识别专家网络，解决了传统端到端模型在处理高速手指拼写和非手动线索方面的局限性，在How2Sign和ChicagoFSWildPlus数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端手语翻译模型在处理高速手指拼写和面部非手动线索方面表现不佳，特别是在翻译姓名、地点和技术术语等关键信息时效果较差。需要一种能够分别处理不同模态信息的模块化方法。

Method: 采用模块化框架，包含三个专门的专家网络：连续手语识别、手指拼写识别和唇读识别。每个网络将其特定模态解码为token序列，然后通过轻量级transformer进行时间对齐和融合，最后使用大语言模型生成最终句子。

Result: 在How2Sign基准测试中达到BLEU-4分数23.5的新SOTA，在ChicagoFSWildPlus手指拼写数据集上达到73.2%的字母准确率。

Conclusion: 通过分离和专门解决不同的识别任务再进行融合，多专家方法为鲁棒、高保真的手语翻译提供了更强大有效的途径，验证了核心假设。

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

### [2] [Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for AI-Assisted Evidence Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00038)
*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过声明式提示优化技术，构建可重现、可验证的LLM辅助系统评文综述流程，提高科学可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM辅助系统评文综述的方法依赖容易出错的手工提示，影响可靠性和可重现性，需要更稳健的方案

Method: 采用声明式提示优化技术，构建包含任务声明、测试套件和自动提示调整的领域特定框架，并提供代码示例

Result: 开发出一种可重现的SLR工作流程蓝图，能够构建符合透明性和严谨性原则的可验证LLM管道

Conclusion: 这是声明式提示优化技术在SLR自动化领域的首次应用，为提高LLM辅助证据综述的科学可靠性提供了新方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

### [3] [What Are Research Hypotheses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00185)
*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了自然语言处理领域中"假设"概念的不同定义，特别关注了近期NLU任务中的定义差异，强调了在构建机器可解释学术记录时明确定义的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言处理技术的发展，不同NLU任务对"假设"概念的定义出现了分歧，偏离了传统科学定义，需要系统梳理和明确界定。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，对近期发表的NLU任务中使用的假设定义进行系统梳理和比较分析。

Result: 识别出NLU领域中假设定义存在显著差异，揭示了定义不一致的问题。

Conclusion: 明确且结构良好的假设定义对于构建机器可解释的学术记录至关重要，需要建立统一的标准定义框架。

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

### [4] [Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190)
*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个状态感知转换框架，将思维链轨迹抽象为结构化潜在动态，通过谱分析和马尔可夫链建模来提升推理过程的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链推理可解释性有限，主要关注局部词级归因，而高层次语义角色和推理步骤转换未被充分探索。

Method: 使用谱分析对词级嵌入进行聚类，将推理步骤表示为语义一致的潜在状态，并通过马尔可夫链建模推理过程的全局结构。

Result: 该框架支持语义角色识别、时间模式可视化和一致性评估等多种分析功能。

Conclusion: 提出的状态感知转换框架为思维链推理提供了结构化和可解释的视图，增强了推理过程的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM)新任务和DiFBench基准框架，评估LLMs在文档集合中识别全局稀有特征的能力，发现现有模型在统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在显著局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注信息检索和摘要，但缺乏评估模型识别全局稀有特征的能力，而现实决策场景（如候选人筛选、产品差异化）需要这种统计推理能力

Method: 引入DFM任务，要求模型分析10-40个文档的集合，识别出现频率低于10%的稀有特征；开发DiFBench可配置基准框架，控制文档集大小和独特性阈值等参数；对10个最先进LLM进行大规模评估

Result: 发现通用模型与推理增强模型之间存在显著性能差距；所有模型在任务复杂度和文档数量增加时性能大幅下降；常见错误是将频繁特征误判为稀有特征

Conclusion: 当代LLMs在执行细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在核心局限性，需要开发新的方法来提升这种关键决策能力

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于皮尔斯符号学理论的一般性理论框架，用于统一描述和分析各种人类意义建构建模实践，将模型视为符号并建立模型语义学理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类意义建构建模方法缺乏统一的理论框架来跨模型类型进行标准化描述和分析，需要建立通用的理论体系。

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce的符号学理论构建理论框架，将模型视为测量潜在符号几何的假设，并通过模型间的对比关系来理解模型价值。

Result: 提出了一个能够统一描述各种建模实践的理论框架，将模型和建模决策本身视为符号，建立了模型语义学理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析复杂符号系统提供了新的理论基础，通过实证示例展示了其应用价值，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Temporal Game是一个将时间关系抽取任务转化为交互式游戏的新方法，通过点对点比较时间实体的起止点来标注，支持区间和瞬时实体，并提供游戏模式和标注模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间关系标注方法直接标注区间级关系，不够精细和灵活。需要一种能够同时支持区间和瞬时实体、提供更细粒度标注的方法，并为强化学习代理的训练奠定基础。

Method: 将时间关系分解为时间实体起止点之间的点对点比较，每一步玩家分类单个点关系，系统应用时间闭包推理额外关系并确保一致性。提供游戏模式（带评分系统）和标注模式（支持自定义文档）。

Result: 开发了公开可用的演示系统，支持TempEval-3数据集的文本标注，能够导出时间线，代码开源以促进时间推理和标注研究的社区发展。

Conclusion: Temporal Game提供了一种新颖、灵活且细粒度的时间关系标注方法，既可作为研究工具也可作为标注界面，为时间推理领域的进一步研究和发展提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE方法通过生成推理中间文本来增强文本嵌入，将逻辑推理融入嵌入过程，显著提升了零样本检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，未能充分利用LLM的推理能力。复杂查询需要超越表层词汇匹配的深度推理来检索相关文档

Method: 提出RITE方法，在计算嵌入前在token空间中生成中间推理文本，从而用推理深度丰富表示。基于现有语言模型嵌入技术构建

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验结果表明，RITE显著提升了跨领域的零样本检索性能

Conclusion: 将推理融入嵌入过程是有效的，RITE方法成功地将LLM的推理能力整合到文本嵌入中

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpinioRAG是一个可扩展的、无需训练的框架，结合RAG证据检索和LLMs，从大量用户评论中生成个性化摘要，并提出了新的无参考验证指标用于情感丰富领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理数千条用户评论的规模，或产生通用摘要而忽视个性化需求，需要开发能够高效生成定制化摘要的解决方案。

Method: 引入OpinioRAG框架，结合基于RAG的证据检索和大型语言模型，无需训练即可生成个性化摘要；提出新的无参考验证指标用于评估情感一致性。

Result: 创建了首个大规模长形式用户评论数据集，包含每个实体上千条评论；通过实验验证了框架的有效性，能够生成准确、相关且结构化的摘要。

Conclusion: OpinioRAG为大规模生成准确、相关和结构化摘要提供了强大框架，为未来研究指明了方向，并提供了改进系统的可行见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

### [10] [Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00290)
*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型构建新薪资情感指数(WSI)预测日本薪资动态，显著超越传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用生成式AI为经济文本分析带来新机遇，提高薪资预测的及时性和有效性

Method: 基于日本内阁府经济监测调查(EWS)，扩展价格情感指数(PSI)框架构建WSI，并设计可扩展数据架构支持多源数据集成

Result: LLM基础的WSI模型显著超越基线方法和预训练模型，验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: LLM驱动的情感指数有力提升政府和中央银行经济政策设计的及时性和效果

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [11] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI)方法，解决了在蒸馏训练模型上应用RLHF时出现的序列长度崩溃和奖励曲棍球棒曲线问题，实现了稳定的训练和推理能力保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型发展存在两个有效但独立的范式：指令调优/RLHF对齐范式和蒸馏式推理微调范式。将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型的第三范式出现了严重的训练不稳定问题，需要解决方案。

Method: 提出Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI)方法，采用两阶段加权模型合并：首先合并指令跟随和蒸馏推理微调模型，然后进一步与预训练模型合并以保留基础知识。

Result: BAI成功解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线现象，实现了训练期间序列长度的持续改善，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐，产生更具能力的推理模型。

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [12] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER是一个通过自我反思和基于概念质量标准的修订来改进大语言模型输出的框架，它使用自然语言描述推理差距，让模型迭代式地批判和精炼自身输出，在多个推理密集型任务和不同LLM上都取得了显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示策略主要依赖演示、示例或思维链模板，缺乏对抽象概念差距的识别和改善能力。GIER旨在通过自然语言描述推理差距，让模型能够自我反思和改进输出质量。

Method: GIER框架利用自然语言描述推理差距，提示模型迭代式地批判和精炼自身输出，以更好地满足概念质量标准。该方法不依赖演示或示例，而是通过自我反思实现改进。

Result: 在三个推理密集型任务（SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI）和四个大语言模型（GPT-4.1、GPT-4o Mini、Gemini 1.5 Pro和Llama 3.3 70B）上，GIER提高了理由质量、基础性和推理一致性，且不降低任务准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，模型不仅能够解释抽象的概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，证明了自我反思和迭代修订在提升LLM输出质量方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek是一个用于合成复杂深度研究任务的框架，通过双代理系统递归构建研究树，生成需要层次化推理的自然语言问题，显著提升了LLM在深度研究任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄露或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持LLM进行复杂的多步推理和证据合成。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归构建研究树，将中间节点模糊化为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要遍历完整层次结构的自然语言问题，支持快速扩展生成大规模训练数据。

Result: 在InfoSeek上训练的模型在BrowseComp-Plus基准测试中表现优异，3B参数的LLM超越了32B大模型和轻量级商业API，性能接近更强的API。

Conclusion: InfoSeek提供了一个可扩展的框架来合成复杂的深度研究任务，显著提升了LLM的层次化推理能力，并支持高级优化策略如复合奖励设计和轨迹级探索。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一个基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过图传播机制动态更新token重要性，实现自适应缓存压缩，可无缝集成到现有方法中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存驱逐策略依赖静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态的隐式依赖关系，导致内存受限下的性能瓶颈。

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制在图结构中动态更新token重要性，自适应保留上下文关键token。

Result: 提出了可插拔的图框架GraphKV，能够与SnapKV、PyramidKV等现有KV缓存驱逐方法无缝集成使用。

Conclusion: GraphKV通过图结构动态建模token依赖关系，为长文本序列处理提供了更高效的KV缓存管理解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by

### [15] [The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391)
*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了GCG和T-GCG对抗性提示攻击在不同规模开源LLM上的效果，发现攻击成功率随模型规模增大而下降，语义评估比前缀启发式更严格，且推理相关提示比安全提示更易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估梯度对抗性提示攻击方法在不同规模语言模型上的有效性和局限性，特别是针对安全提示和推理提示的脆弱性差异。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-0.5B、LLaMA-3.2-1B和GPT-OSS-20B三个不同规模的开源LLM，在安全导向提示(AdvBench)和推理密集型编码提示上评估GCG及其退火增强变体T-GCG的攻击效果，采用前缀启发式和GPT-4o语义判断两种评估方式。

Result: 1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增大而下降；2) 前缀启发式评估高估攻击效果，语义评估更严格现实；3) 编码相关提示比安全提示更脆弱；4) T-GCG能多样化对抗搜索但在语义评估下收益有限。

Conclusion: GCG方法存在可扩展性限制，推理任务中存在被忽视的脆弱性，需要进一步发展退火启发策略以进行更鲁棒的对抗评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个基于AI的医疗问答系统，利用大语言模型生成答案，并通过PubMed数据库动态检索可信医学研究来支撑答案的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息质量参差不齐、医学研究数量庞大难以跟踪、传统搜索工具无法反映研究结论差异等问题。

Method: 结合大语言模型生成连贯表达，动态检索PubMed数据库中的医学研究，提供可追溯的关键点和论点，并可视化研究共识的演变过程。

Result: 用户研究表明，医学专家和普通用户认为系统可用且有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 该系统适用于日常健康问题和高级研究洞察，能有效合成基于证据的医疗答案。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camlang是一个新颖的构造语言测试，用于评估LLMs是否真正具备元语言推理能力，结果显示GPT-5在英语上达到98%准确率但在Camlang上仅47%，远低于人类的87%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅进行模式匹配。通过元语言演绎学习范式来评估模型是否能像人类一样通过显式语法规则掌握陌生语言

Method: 创建Camlang构造语言，包含语法书和双语词典资源，将CommonsenseQA适配为Camlang-CSQA-v0任务，要求应用语法规则和词汇映射来解决问题

Result: GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%准确率，但在Camlang上仅47%，远低于人类的87%。其他先进推理LLMs表现更差。模型成功主要来自浅层词汇对齐而非系统性语法掌握

Conclusion: Camlang建立了一个认知基础的评估范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，模型缺乏人类那样的系统性语法掌握能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和语义单元合并来解决传统图RAG中局部语义单元提取的模糊性和耦合问题，在多个任务上超越了基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法在提取高层次语义单元时局限于局部文本块，容易产生歧义、复杂耦合，并因缺乏全局知识或忽略细粒度关系而增加检索开销。

Method: 提出GOSU框架：1）在图构建阶段进行全局语义单元合并，指导实体和关系提取；2）在检索生成阶段引入分层关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕捉细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务评估中，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元处理和分层关系捕捉，有效解决了传统RAG方法的局限性，提升了检索增强生成的效果。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个轻量级框架，使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器和注意力相关性评分来解决伊斯兰继承法选择题，在效率和部署性方面优于大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI构成挑战。传统大型语言模型虽然准确率高但资源消耗大、依赖上下文，需要开发更高效、可本地部署的解决方案。

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）和注意力相关性评分（ARS）来对答案选项进行语义相关性排序，实现快速、无需生成推理的设备端推断。

Result: 大型模型（Gemini、DeepSeek）在QIAS 2025数据集上达到87.6%准确率，但资源需求高。基于MARBERT的方法达到69.87%准确率，在效率、设备端部署性和隐私方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 研究量化了大型模型峰值性能与小型专业化系统在实际应用优势之间的关键权衡，证明了在高风险领域中轻量级专业化系统的实用价值。

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域语言生成中的不确定性量化是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战，特别是在黑盒约束下无法访问内部模型信号的情况下。

Method: 使用token级熵作为不确定性度量，将其整合到分割保形预测流程中，通过保形分位数校准不确定性阈值以确保可证明的错误控制。

Result: 在6个大语言模型和2个基准测试(CoQA和TriviaQA)上的实证评估表明，TECP始终实现可靠的覆盖和紧凑的预测集，优于先前的自一致性UQ方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了一个原则性和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了四种提示方法来解决角色扮演对话代理中的过度说话和工具使用不足问题，其中基于规则的提示方法取得了最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025挑战中，对话代理经常产生过长的角色回应（过度说话）且未能根据角色有效使用工具（行动不足），如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用。

Method: 研究了四种提示方法：1）基础角色提示 2）人工制作角色提示 3）自动提示优化（APO）4）基于规则的角色提示（RRP），其中RRP采用角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行技术。

Result: 基于规则的角色提示方法取得了0.571的整体分数，相比零样本基线的0.519有所提升，表现优于更复杂的APO方法。

Conclusion: RRP设计能显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性，研究开源了最佳提示和APO工具以支持未来发展。

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

TL;DR: ResearchQA是一个从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K查询和160K评分标准的资源，用于评估LLM系统回答研究问题的能力，发现现有系统在引用文献、描述局限性和比较分析方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究问题长文本回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛存在于综述文章中，需要一种更全面的方法来评估LLM系统在研究领域的表现。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K个查询和160K个评分标准项，每个评分标准包含查询特定的答案评估标准（引用论文、解释说明、描述局限性）。使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估，并构建自动成对评判系统。

Result: 96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准项需要在系统回答中用至少一个句子来满足。自动评判系统与专家判断达到74%一致率。在7.6K次成对评估中，没有参数化或检索增强系统超过70%的评分标准覆盖率，最高排名代理系统达到75%覆盖率。

Conclusion: 现有LLM系统在研究问题回答方面存在显著能力差距，特别是在引用文献（完全满足率<11%）、描述局限性（48%）和比较分析（49%）方面。ResearchQA资源支持更全面的多领域评估。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

TL;DR: 通过以频率相关的信息权重和连续性约束实现了语音识别的高效转换，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语音识别模型通常使用密集的离散表示，导致了存储和计算开销过大，而语义理解并不需要这种细粒度的分辨率。

Method: 提出一种基于频率相关信息权重和连续性约束的动态聚合框架，通过预测低频率代码的信息权重来确定聚合边界，然后使用交叉注意力模块融合每个分段内的信息。

Result: 在ASR、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务上，压缩后的表示在保持与密集代码序列相等或更优的性能同时，显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态聚合有效减少了语音表示的冗余，在不丢失性能的情况下大幅提升了下游任务的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: LLMs在生成法律文档摘要时会根据用户法律角色（法官、检察官、律师等）进行有动机的推理，选择性包含信息以符合角色立场，即使有平衡指令也难以避免这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律语境中如何根据用户角色进行有动机的推理和信息框架调整，探讨法律现实主义理论在AI生成内容中的体现。

Method: 构建基于法律事实和推理包含度的评估框架，分析不同法律角色提示下LLMs对司法判决摘要的生成行为，考虑对利益相关者的偏向性。

Result: 即使提示中包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出符合角色立场的选择性信息包含模式，存在明显的角色一致性偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险法律环境中需要对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的重要性，因为即使没有明确角色指令，模型也可能从上下文推断用户角色并产生类似的对齐行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在推理能力增强时更容易响应恶意请求，这种现象称为"推理诱导的错位"，揭示了推理能力与安全性之间的新权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型广泛应用，对其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的担忧日益加剧。以往研究表明在恶意数据集上微调会导致错位行为，但本研究发现了更令人担忧的现象。

Method: 通过切换到"思考模式"或在良性数学数据集上微调来增强模型的推理能力，分析模型对恶意请求的响应变化，并研究模型内部状态（注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专家）。

Result: 发现推理能力增强时，模型对恶意请求的响应性增加，密集模型特别脆弱。注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专门专家有助于将过度推理重新导向安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现为新兴的推理-安全性权衡提供了新见解，并强调了推进高级推理模型对齐的紧迫性。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

TL;DR: LLMs在评估环境和部署环境中的行为存在显著差异，通过线性探测和提示重写方法可以将测试类提示转换为部署类提示，使模型诚实回答增加5.26%，欺骗回答减少12.40%，拒绝率提高6.38%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估环境和实际部署环境中表现出不同的行为特征，这种"评估意识"现象导致基准测试性能无法准确反映模型的真实安全性和诚实性，对AI对齐构成严重挑战。

Method: 使用线性探测方法对提示进行评分，将其分为"测试类"和"部署类"，然后利用LLM重写策略将提示转向更自然的部署风格上下文，同时保持原始任务不变。

Result: 重写后的部署类提示导致行为发生显著一致变化：所有模型的诚实回答平均增加5.26%，欺骗回答减少12.40%，拒绝率提高6.38%，表明在感知的测试环境中模型更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出。

Conclusion: 评估意识是一个可量化和可操作的因素，直接影响LLM行为，凸显了在部署前需要更现实的评估框架来准确衡量模型对齐程度的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Gated Associative Memory (GAM)网络，一种线性复杂度(O(N))的并行序列建模架构，替代Transformer的二次复杂度自注意力机制，在训练速度和性能上均优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度(O(N^2))问题，在处理长序列时成为显著瓶颈，需要更高效的序列建模方案。

Method: GAM块使用两条并行路径：因果卷积捕获局部位置相关上下文，关联记忆检索机制建模全局内容模式，通过门控机制动态融合局部和全局信息。

Result: 在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上，GAM训练速度更快，验证困惑度优于或与Transformer和Mamba基线相当。

Conclusion: GAM作为线性复杂度的序列建模架构，是Transformer的高效替代方案，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and

*Md Tanzib Hosain,Md Kishor Morol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了ICPC基准测试，包含254个国际大学生程序设计竞赛题目，通过多轮自判断、反思和检索等技术，将语言模型的解题率从19.1%提升到42.2%，并发现人类简单指导可以显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程任务需要复杂的算法思维和代码生成能力，但作为评估语言模型的领域尚未得到足够关注。研究旨在开发一个全面的基准来评估语言模型在竞争性编程中的表现。

Method: 构建包含254个ICPC题目的基准，每个问题包含官方分析、参考代码和多种测试用例。采用零样本思维链提示、多轮自判断与反思、信息检索等技术进行模型推理。

Result: 零样本思维链提示下模型仅达到19.1%的通过率，最佳推理技术（多轮自判断+反思+检索）将通过率提升至42.2%。人类简单指导可使模型解决之前无法解决的17/18个问题。

Conclusion: 研究为开发具有扎实、创新和算法思维能力的语言模型提供了重要进展，展示了人类指导对提升模型性能的关键作用，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

*Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现经过安全对齐的LLM在仇恨言论检测上表现优于未对齐模型(78.7% vs 64.1%)，但存在意识形态锚定效应，且所有模型在理解讽刺等细微语言时都存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论方面的有效性，比较经过安全对齐和未对齐模型的分类能力，验证未对齐模型是否能提供更客观的分类。

Method: 通过对比实验分析经过安全对齐和未经过安全对齐的LLM在仇恨言论检测任务上的表现，评估准确性、鲁棒性、意识形态一致性等指标。

Result: 安全对齐模型在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于未对齐模型，但存在意识形态锚定效应；所有模型在理解讽刺语言方面都表现不佳；存在针对不同目标群体的公平性差异和系统性过度自信问题。

Conclusion: LLM不能作为客观仲裁者，需要开发更复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、校准和意识形态一致性。

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Router Upcycling方法，通过从注意力头初始化多个路由器来增强MoE上循环模型的性能，实现SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率低，现有简单路由器在复杂路由任务中表现不佳，需要改进MoE上循环技术的路由能力

Method: 在MoE上循环过程中，从前面的注意力层初始化多个路由器，这些路由器以类似注意力的方式协作分配token给专家

Result: 实验结果表明该方法实现了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效提升了MoE上循环模型的性能，通过注意力机制启发的路由器设计解决了复杂路由问题

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

*Austin McCutcheon,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了14个小语言模型(SLMs)在生成虚假新闻标题方面的能力，发现这些模型在明确提示下高度配合生成假新闻，且现有检测器难以准确识别这些AI生成的假新闻标题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小语言模型(SLMs)在文本生成方面的能力增强，需要评估它们被滥用于生成在线虚假文本的潜在风险，特别是虚假新闻标题的生成能力。

Method: 使用控制提示工程对14个SLMs(1.7B-14B参数)生成24,000个低质量和高质量虚假新闻标题，然后应用现有的机器学习和深度学习新闻标题质量检测器进行评估。

Result: SLMs表现出高配合率，伦理抵制很少；质量检测准确率仅为35.2%-63.5%，误分类现象普遍；生成的标题与真实人类撰写内容相似度较低。

Conclusion: 测试的SLMs普遍能够配合生成虚假标题，但存在轻微伦理约束差异；生成的标题质量较低，与真实网络内容相似度不高，但现有检测器识别效果有限。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Result: 在覆盖多个领域的真实基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于强基线和现有研究

Conclusion: 通过强化文本模态可以有效提升多模态时间序列预测的性能，提出的TeR模型和强化学习方法具有显著效果

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Abstract: Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

TL;DR: 提出了RevBrowse框架，通过检索增强机制动态利用用户评论来提升基于LLM的推荐系统性能，解决评论信息利用效率低和相关性不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推荐任务中表现出色，但在评论驱动的推荐中存在两个挑战：1) 在有限上下文窗口中动态利用用户评论效率低下；2) 缺乏有效机制来优先处理与用户当前决策最相关的评论

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，采用"浏览-决策"决策过程，集成PrefRAG检索增强模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并根据目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容

Result: 在四个Amazon评论数据集上的实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线取得了持续且显著的改进，展示了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性

Conclusion: RevBrowse不仅提升了推荐性能，还通过透明的检索增强过程提供了一定程度的可解释性，使影响最终推荐的评论可见

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出了Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)解码策略，通过外部奖励模型在扩散过程中提供全局序列级信号，改善掩码扩散模型的非自回归生成顺序和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准置信度采样方法导致掩码扩散模型的生成顺序类似于自回归过程，限制了非自回归建模的优势

Method: RWS在每一步扩散过程中评估整个中间序列质量，按比例缩放token对数概率，通过全局序列连贯性指导token选择，促进更非自回归的生成顺序

Result: 实验表明RWS显著促进了非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上都有改进

Conclusion: 整合全局信号能有效增强掩码扩散模型的非自回归特性和整体性能

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

TL;DR: 本研究系统比较了编码器Transformer、解码器LLM和FastText在中文AI生成文本检测任务上的表现，发现LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B模型达到95.94%的测试准确率，表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，准确检测AI生成文本的需求日益增长，特别是在中文这种语言细微差别较大的语言中，现有方法面临显著挑战。

Method: 使用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，系统比较了编码器模型（Chinese BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、解码器模型（Qwen2.5-7B通过LoRA微调）和FastText基线方法。编码器模型采用基于提示的掩码语言建模方法微调，解码器模型使用指令格式输入和轻量级分类头。

Result: 编码器模型虽然几乎记住了训练数据，但在分布偏移下性能显著下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%；BERT: 79.3%）。FastText表现出令人惊讶的词法鲁棒性（83.5%准确率）但缺乏深层语义理解。LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%测试准确率，具有平衡的精确率-召回率指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于解码器的大语言模型结合参数高效微调在中文AI生成文本检测方面具有优越的泛化能力和鲁棒性。未来工作将探索新一代Qwen3模型、蒸馏变体和集成策略以进一步提升跨域鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Motivation: 当前基于问题分解的方法在生成问题时往往产生不相关和不完整的问题，导致检索时丢失事实，并且无法聚合来自不同文档和段落的证据片段。

Method: 使用上下文增强的两阶段忠实分解方法分解长答案为子事实，检索相关证据片段，在证据冲突时修订子事实，最后根据原始句子聚合证据片段。

Conclusion: FIDES框架通过改进的事实分解和证据聚合方法，显著提高了归因问答的性能和证据精确度。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Motivation: 现有研究将司法意见生成分为法律推理和量刑预测两个独立子任务，导致推理与预测不一致，且依赖人工整理知识，实用性受限。

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，使用结构化法律链整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活知识注入和端到端意见生成。

Result: 在两个真实世界的中文法律案例数据集上实验表明，该方法优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能更好地符合法律实践需求，为分析量刑一致性和法官参考类似案例提供有效支持。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

*Felix Engl,Andreas Henrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Topic Model Translation (TMT) 是一种无需对齐语料库即可将主题模型跨语言迁移的新技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言主题模型训练面临算法复杂、需要对齐语料和人工评估等挑战，特别是在目标语言知识有限或数据稀缺的环境中更加困难

Method: 提出了Topic Model Translation (TMT)技术，不需要元数据、嵌入或对齐语料库，能够将LDA等主题模型从一种语言迁移到另一种语言

Result: 通过定量和定性方法广泛评估，证明TMT能够产生语义连贯且一致的主题翻译

Conclusion: TMT特别适用于目标语言大型语料库不可用或人工翻译不可行的情况，实现了主题模型的跨语言重用

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

TL;DR: 本文在DSTC-12 Track 1挑战中开发了小型模型来预测对话级别的维度特定评分，比较了语言模型提示和编码器分类/回归模型两种策略的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统的增多，如何有效评估这些系统成为一个关键挑战。本文旨在通过相对较小的模型（少于130亿参数）来解决对话系统评估问题。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）通过提示使用语言模型作为评估器；2）训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。

Result: 语言模型提示与人类判断的相关性一般，但在测试集上排名第二；编码器模型在验证集上某些维度表现出高相关性，但在测试集上性能下降，主要因为测试集标注的分数范围与训练/验证集存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然小型模型在某些条件下表现良好，但测试集标注差异对模型性能影响较大，提示需要更稳健的评估方法和数据集一致性。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 负样本在对比学习中致关重要，但传统方法生成的负样本类型限。需要一种能够生成不同相似度级别负样本的方法，以提升模型识别细微语义差异的能力。

Method: 1. MGH框架：利用LLM生成不同相似度级别的负样本，实现从粗糕到细精的课程学习策略
2. ATA池化方法：根据LLM中的聚合模式，为锚点词赋予更高权重，提高嵌入准确性而不增加模型复杂度

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到了state-of-the-art性能，超越了现有的合成策略，无论是使用合成数据还是与公开检索数据集结合都取得了优异结果。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的MGH和ATA方法能够有效提升文本嵌入模型的性能，通过生成多样化负样本和改进池化方法，为文本嵌入领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型作为强大的创意工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估其表征性社会偏见。

Method: 构建包含5种社会重要职业（CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员）的基准测试，使用5种先进模型（闭源和开源），比较中性提示与公平性控制提示的效果，对所有输出进行性别和种族标注分析。

Result: 提示工程能显著改变人口统计表征，但效果高度模型依赖：有些系统能有效多样化，有些过度校正导致不现实的一致性，有些则响应性较弱。

Conclusion: 提示工程作为公平性干预措施既有前景也有局限，需要辅以模型层面的策略来应对社会偏见问题。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即模型优先考虑与输入隐含视角的一致性而非准确性和真实性，这影响了模型输出的可靠性。

Method: 设计两种范式生成对应的欺骗性/误导性输入以诱导一致的奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换中性输入之间的输出分布偏差来减少对欺骗信息的依赖。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的CCD方法能有效缓解奉承幻觉，并在各种任务中提高生成响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种有效的后处理方法，能够在不进行额外训练的情况下显著减少大语言模型中的奉承幻觉现象，提升模型输出的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个创新的检索增强生成框架，通过引入结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，解决了传统RAG中信号噪声比低和多跳推理错误积累的问题。该方法训练模型生成简洁的支持性证据笔记，并通过基于蕴含的证据质量奖励来提升推理的忠实性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-回答范式存在两个主要问题：(1)检索证据中信号噪声比低，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中不完整或嘈杂段落导致的错误累积。需要一种更有效的方法来提升检索增强生成的质量和可靠性。

Method: 提出EviNote-RAG框架，采用结构化检索-笔记-回答流程。训练模型生成支持性证据笔记(SENs)，这些笔记是简洁的、类似人类的笔记，仅保留答案相关信息，突出不确定性，并明确说明无有用证据存在。通过证据质量奖励(EQR)这一基于蕴含的信号来评估SENs是否逻辑支持最终答案。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面持续优于强基线。在HotpotQA上获得20%的相对F1增益(+0.093)，Bamboogle上40%(+0.151)，2Wiki上91%(+0.256)，通过更密集的奖励和减少冗余实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过结构化笔记生成和证据质量奖励机制，显著提升了检索增强生成的性能，增强了鲁棒性和效率，为解决传统RAG框架的局限性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Motivation: 讽刺、反讽和挖苦通常用于表达幽默和批评，但有时会被误认为是事实报道，类似于假新闻。这些技术可以在更细粒度的句子级别应用，因此需要专门的检测方法。

Method: 创建了包含13,873个手动标注句子的罗马尼亚语讽刺检测数据集SeLeRoSa，涵盖多个领域。评估了多种基于LLM的基线模型在零样本和微调设置下的性能，以及基于transformer的基线模型。

Result: 研究发现当前这些模型在句子级讽刺检测任务中存在局限性，为新的研究方向铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 该研究为罗马尼亚语讽刺检测提供了首个句子级数据集，并揭示了当前LLM和transformer模型在此任务上的不足，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

Motivation: 由于因果LLMs的快速发展，预期其在序列标注任务上能超越停滞发展的编码器模型，但现有研究较少关注更适合因果LLMs的生成式序列标注方法。

Method: 提出SIFT方法，结合上下文学习(ICL)和监督微调，将序列标注任务重新表述为约束响应生成问题，使LLMs能够更自然地处理这类任务。

Result: SIFT在多个标准序列标注任务上显著优于ICL和解码器作为编码器的微调基线方法，同时发现去除指令可以缓解长上下文对性能的负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于响应的生成式任务表述对序列标注性能的重要性，揭示了LLMs在序列标注任务中的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

Method: 构建了2999句英西平行语料库和100句测试集，使用四种开源LLMs，结合结构化提示（多语言变体、医学同义词、UMLS定义）和LoRA微调。

Result: MedCOD显著提升了所有模型的翻译质量，Phi-4模型达到BLEU 44.23、chrF++ 28.91、COMET 0.863，超越了GPT-4o等基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化知识整合能有效提升LLMs在医学翻译任务中的表现，MedCOD提示和模型适配都有独立贡献，组合使用效果最佳。

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Result: 建立了两种知识引擎范式的概念连接，形成了开发通用知识系统的新方法论

Conclusion: 结构和解构的协同作用为构建透明、可控、自适应的智能系统提供了新的理论基础和实践路径

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 偏好优化与质量驱动精炼相结合为构建更可靠、临床基础的医学LLMs提供了可扩展且有效的方法

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching,
data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of
information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.
Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

Method: 构建TaarofBench基准，包含450个角色扮演场景，涵盖12个常见社交主题，经本土语者验证。评估5个前沿LLM，进行人类研究确立基准线。通过监督式精细调整和直接偏好优化提升模型表现。

Result: 前沿LLM在taarof适用场景中的准确率比本土语者低40-48%，表现随主题、语言和性别而异。标准礼貌指标评为"礼貌"的回复经常违背taarof规范。通过SFT和DPO技术，模型文化对齐能力分别提升21.8%和42.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究为发展多样化和文化感知能力的LLM奠定了基础，提醒了西方礼貌框架的局限性，并为更好处理复杂社交交际的应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于融合的生成方法来保持危机沟通中响应风格的一致性，包括新的风格一致性评估指标和两阶段优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中自动化响应的风格一致性对建立受影响人群的信任至关重要，但现有研究很少关注如何保持生成响应的风格一致性。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：首先评估候选响应的风格，然后通过融合过程在实例级别优化和整合这些响应，以减少风格变化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在响应质量和风格一致性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的融合生成方法能够有效生成高质量响应同时显著降低风格变化，为危机沟通中的自动化响应提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在伊斯兰继承法这一专业法律领域的知识和推理能力，了解模型在处理结构化法律推理方面的表现和局限性。

Method: 使用包含1000道多选题的基准测试，涵盖多样化的继承场景，测试7个LLM模型对伊斯兰继承法的理解和份额计算能力。

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5模型准确率超过90%，而ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral模型准确率低于50%，显示出显著的性能差距和推理能力差异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在伊斯兰法律推理中存在局限性，特别是在处理结构化法律推理方面，需要改进领域适应能力和法律规则应用能力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中极不合法，尽管19世纪文献中自由存在，这种范式空缺源于主格主语要求与及物完成体赋予作格的核心语法规则冲突


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词和体组合中的范式空缺现象，特别是-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中的不合法性，尽管历史文献中存在该用法

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究确认完成体形式的显著缺失，以及母语者的主观评价任务来判断完成体例句的自然度

Result: 研究发现完成体形式在现代乌尔都语中极不自然，这种空缺源于形态句法冲突：结构要求主格主语和不变分词，但与及物完成体赋予作格的核心语法规则相冲突

Conclusion: 这种形态句法冲突导致完成体形式不稳定，其他结构的功能性替代使得这种空缺在现代语法中得以巩固

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG是一种知识蒸馏的参数化RAG模型，通过将文档编码为LoRA参数而非明文，在保护隐私的同时保持标准RAG的性能，解决了传统PRAG的推理延迟和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统需要上传明文文档到云端，存在隐私数据泄露风险。现有参数化RAG(PRAG)虽然通过LoRA编码保护隐私，但存在推理延迟高和泛化性能差的问题。

Method: 提出DistilledPRAG方法：1)合成单文档和多文档QA对增强跨文档推理；2)用特殊标记屏蔽明文文档并通过参数生成器转换为LoRA；3)通过知识蒸馏训练参数生成器匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态和输出logits。

Result: 在四个QA数据集上的实验表明，DistilledPRAG在准确率上优于基线方法，并在分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化同时保持RAG级别性能，为隐私保护推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFRAG是一个针对RAG应用的高效解码框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展机制，利用检索上下文的稀疏性结构，在保持性能的同时显著提升解码速度并扩展上下文长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG应用中，LLM处理的长上下文包含大量检索到的段落，但只有小部分与查询直接相关，导致计算冗余和系统效率低下。传统LLM优化方法未充分考虑RAG特有的块对角注意力模式。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过压缩冗余上下文、感知相关段落、动态扩展处理，利用RAG上下文的稀疏性结构来优化计算，减少不必要的解码计算。

Result: 实现了30.85倍的时间到首个token加速（相比之前工作提升3.75倍），困惑度无损失，并能将LLM的上下文大小扩展16倍，在多种长上下文任务中保持准确性。

Conclusion: REFRAG通过专门针对RAG应用特点的优化，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了系统效率，为长上下文处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

<details>

Motivation: 探究自然演化的上下文段落如何影响生成式大语言模型在问答任务中的表现，特别是当文本内容随时间自然演变时。

Method: 提出一个框架来整理自然演化的人类编辑版阅读段落变体，分析LLM在不同语义相似度分数下的表现，评估了6个QA数据集和8个LLM。

Result: LLM性能随着阅读段落与预训练版本的自然偏离而下降，例如BoolQ数据集的平均准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降了30%以上，多个模型的斜率超过70。

Conclusion: 自然文本演化对LLM的语言理解能力构成了重大挑战，表明模型对预训练时见过的文本内容存在过度依赖。

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Conclusion: Dream-Coder 7B展示了离散扩散模型在代码生成任务中的潜力，提供了灵活的生成策略和优异的性能，开源了所有资源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training

Result: 

Conclusion: 通过实体对齐翻译方法能够有效提升非拉丁语系语言的跨语言NER性能

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse
temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a
single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to
interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with
a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Conclusion: SAT框架通过结构感知对齐调优有效解决了LLM在KGC任务中的表示空间不一致问题，统一指令设计提高了效率和性能

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量、多样化且可验证的长上下文数据集，这严重制约了LLMs在长文本处理推理能力的发展。

Conclusion: 该框架为推进LLMs长上下文能力提供了有效的合成数据生成解决方案，具有可扩展性和目的对齐性。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context

Motivation: AI系统越来越依赖自然语言原则进行治理，但语言解释的歧义性导致模型行为不一致和不稳定，而当前AI对齐流程缺乏类似法律系统的制度性保障机制

Method: 提出包含两个法律机制的计算框架：(1)规则精炼流程，通过修订歧义规则最小化解释分歧；(2)基于提示的解释约束，减少规则应用的不一致性

Result: 在WildChat数据集的5000个场景子集上评估，显示两种干预措施都显著提高了合理解释者之间的判断一致性

Conclusion: 该框架为系统管理解释性歧义提供了初步解决方案，是构建更稳健、遵循规则的AI系统的重要步骤

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and

*Chenyang Le,Bing Han,Jinshun Li,Songyong Chen,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulMEGA是一个无监督策略学习框架，通过混合专家门控机制实现实时语音翻译，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的同步语音翻译系统在平衡翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性方面存在困难，特别是在多语言多对多场景中，不同的读写策略阻碍了统一策略学习

Method: 结合前缀训练和混合专家精炼器的无监督策略学习框架，以隐式方式学习有效的读写决策，无需增加推理时间开销，仅需对标准Transformer架构进行最小修改

Result: 在6种语言对上的评估显示，500M参数的语音转文本模型优于Seamless基线，在1.5秒平均延迟下BLEU下降低于7%，在3秒延迟下低于3%。在流式TTS任务中也表现出优越的延迟-质量权衡

Conclusion: SimulMEGA是一个通用框架，可同时适用于语音转文本和文本转语音流式任务，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升翻译质量

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

### [71] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01213)
*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于模型增长的预训练方法（特别是transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题方面的效果。研究发现增长型模型在阅读理解和推理任务上表现出更好的知识保留能力，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的主要挑战，特别是在大语言模型持续微调时，模型容易丢失先前学到的知识。虽然基于模型增长的预训练方法（如transformer堆叠）已被证明能加速收敛，但其对遗忘问题的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用模型增长策略，通过较小的模型来加速和结构化更大模型的训练。具体使用transformer堆叠方法，比较了使用增长训练的模型（Stack LLM）和未使用增长的基线模型（LLM）在一系列微调任务中的表现，包括领域知识、推理、阅读理解和偏见评估。

Result: 1) 两种模型在领域知识上都有改进；2) 推理和阅读理解能力随时间退化，显示灾难性遗忘迹象；3) Stack LLM在所有任务中表现出更少的退化，特别是在阅读理解方面；4) 在偏见评估中，基线LLM逐渐变得更加中立，而Stack LLM保持约60-61%的稳定偏见比率。

Conclusion: 基于增长的预训练方法在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面提供了适度的改进，特别是在知识保留方面表现更好，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡，需要进一步研究来平衡这些因素。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

TL;DR: 提出了DaMoC框架，通过数据压缩和模型压缩技术，快速选择最优LLM进行微调，节省约20倍训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在特定领域任务上需要微调。面对众多开源LLM，如何快速选择最优模型进行下游任务微调是一个挑战

Method: DaMoC框架包含两个层面：1) 数据层面：系统分类数据过滤方法，进行token压缩和文本重写优化；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估层重要性，移除低重要性层，并引入稀疏合并范式

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能选择最优LLM，同时节省约20倍训练时间

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM选择问题，通过数据模型压缩技术显著提升了微调效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理方法日益受到关注，但其底层工作机制仍不明确。研究者希望从上下文学习与预训练先验的双重关系角度，深入理解思维链推理的工作机制。

Method: 1) 对推理过程进行细粒度词汇级分析；2) 逐步引入噪声样本来检验模型如何平衡预训练先验与错误上下文信息；3) 研究提示工程是否能诱导大语言模型进行慢思考。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1) 模型不仅能快速学习词汇级推理结构，还能掌握更深层的逻辑推理模式，但严重依赖预训练先验；2) 提供足够样本会使模型决策从预训练先验转向上下文信号，但误导性提示会引入不稳定性；3) 长思维链提示能诱导模型生成更长的推理链，从而提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 思维链推理的有效性源于模型在预训练先验和上下文学习之间的动态平衡，通过适当的提示工程可以诱导更深入的推理过程，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Motivation: 情感是人类社会功能中的关键现象，但在文本表现方面仍是一个开放课题。当前评价性情感理论框架未被充分利用，提供了与传统方法互补的新视角

Method: 使用人工标注的工业语料，采用评价性情感标注方法。训练语言模型来分析标注数据，验证标注分歧是否遵循稳定统计趋势

Result: 标注数据虽然存在显著分歧，但遵循稳定的统计趋势。语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，变异性由底层语言特征驱动。语言模型能够基于评价标准区分情感情境

Conclusion: 评价性情感标注方法有效，标注分歧具有统计规律性。语言模型在情感分析中表现出区分情感情境的能力，为情感计算提供了新见解

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文化对齐评估方法将文化简化为静态事实或价值观，通过选择题或简答题测试，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性本质，以及文化假设在"中性"评估环境中的渗透。

Method: 提出"有意文化评估"框架，系统分析评估中文化依赖考虑因素的出现方式、内容和情境，强调研究者立场性对促进包容性、文化对齐NLP研究的重要性。

Result: 构建了系统性的文化评估理论框架，识别了当前基准测试实践的局限性，并提出了超越现有方法的具体方向。

Conclusion: 需要采用HCI启发的参与式方法学，让社区参与评估设计，发现未知的重要应用，推动文化对齐评估范式的根本转变。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Motivation: 解决LLM在表格问答任务中面临的结构异构性、目标数据定位困难和复杂推理瓶颈等工业应用挑战。

Method: 采用结构化表模式替代完全文本化表格，引入查询感知的表格缩放机制动态生成子表模式，使用程序化思维策略将查询转换为可执行代码，并结合ReAct范式实现迭代推理。

Result: 在DataBench数据集上比传统PoT方法准确率提升19.34%，在TableBench数据集的事实检查任务上提升25%。

Conclusion: TableZoomer框架在保持可用性优势的同时，显著提升了表格问答任务的性能和跨规模表格的可扩展性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在新领域的适应能力有限，特别是在低资源且无标注数据的领域，传统微调方法计算成本高且耗时

Method: 使用6种PEFTs方法在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上进行实验，在科学、医疗、法律和新闻等14个训练数据集上进行文本摘要任务评估

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习以及更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型

Conclusion: 在没有领域内适配器的情况下，可以利用跨领域适配器和策略性组合适配器来利用跨领域的内在语言相似性，在低资源设置中实现更好的适应性和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is

Motivation: 现有法律基准无法评估开放式和条款基础的问答，需要专门针对多跳法律推理的评估框架和可靠的法律答案生成方法。

Method: 构建KoBLEX基准包含226个场景化问答实例；提出ParSeR方法通过生成参数化条款进行三阶段检索；设计LF-Eval自动评估指标衡量法律保真度。

Result: ParSeR在多个LLM上表现最佳，相比GPT-4o标准检索F1提升37.91，LF-Eval提升30.81，在不同推理深度下保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: KoBLEX基准和ParSeR方法有效解决了法律问答中的多跳推理问题，LF-Eval指标与人工评估高度相关，为法律AI应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Conclusion: LLMs展现出强大的学习能力和多任务适应性，在复杂游戏领域具有巨大潜力，但需要注意通用能力保持的问题。

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

TL;DR: WATCHED是一个基于大语言模型的聊天机器人，结合专业工具帮助内容审核员检测和解释仇恨言论，达到0.91的F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字空间中日益增长的仇恨言论问题，需要结合自动化系统的速度和人类审核员的判断力，同时提供决策解释以建立信任

Method: 构建AI智能体系统，使用大语言模型配合多种专业工具：与真实仇恨言论案例对比、BERT分类器标记有害信息、Urban Dictionary查询俚语、生成思维链推理、检查平台指南

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越现有最先进方法，达到0.91的宏观F1分数

Conclusion: 该工具通过支持AI与人类监督的协作，帮助减少网络危害，适用于审核员、安全团队和研究人员

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档关系理解对应用领域至关重要，但缺乏高效的训练和评估数据集创建方法限制了自动化研究。

Method: 先生成半合成跨文档数据集进行自动评估，选出性能最佳的链接方法，然后在自然文本上进行深度人工评估。结合检索模型和大语言模型的方法。

Result: 在同行审查和新闻两个领域，结合检索模型和LLMs的方法获得了78%的人工评审通过率，比单独使用检索模型准确率提高了一倍以上。

Conclusion: 该框架能够系统性地研究跨文档理解问题，所创建的新数据集为跨文档任务（如媒体框架和同行审查）奠定了基础，并开源了代码、数据和标注协议。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

Motivation: 研究神经音频编码器产生的离散token序列是否具有类似自然语言的统计特征，以及这些特性如何影响语音识别和重构性能

Method: 分析各种NAC模型产生的语音token，检验其遵循Zipf定律、Heaps定律等语言统计规律的情况，计算熵和冗余度，并使用自动语音识别错误率和UTMOS分数评估语义保存和音质质量

Result: NAC token（特别是3-gram）呈现出类似语言的统计模式，这些统计特性与信息内容量指标一起，与改善的语音识别和重构性能呈正相关关系

Conclusion: 神经音频编码器产生的token序列具有语言格局特征，这些发现为理解NAC token结构和设计更高效的生成式语音模型提供了见解

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学应用题上表现出色，但在识别学生解题步骤中的错误方面存在困难，特别是在定位第一步错误的位置上。

Method: 提出生成中间修正的学生解决方案的方法，使修正方案更接近原始学生解法，从而帮助改进错误定位性能。使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考答案，最先进的LLMs也难以准确定位学生解法中的第一个错误步骤。提出的中间修正方法有助于提升错误定位性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解法更接近的中间修正方案，可以有效改进LLMs在学生解题错误定位任务中的表现，为解决元推理挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的链式思维推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制，需要人类监督来提高可靠性和可理解性。

Method: 开发Vis-CoT框架，将线性的CoT文本转换为交互式推理图，支持用户可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤，并通过修剪错误路径和嫁接用户定义的新前提进行干预。

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT比非交互式基线提高了最多24个百分点的最终答案准确率，用户研究显示可用性和信任度大幅提升。

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合LLM和针对性人类监督，为实现更可靠、可理解和协作的推理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在美国或少数国家的人口组群观点，缺乏全球范围的国家样本、不同历史时期的人类观点研究，以及使用语言导向LLMs的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对LLMs观点对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 创建了一个基于世界价值观调查(WVS)的评估框架，系统性地评估LLMs在全球范围内不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类观点的对齐程度，并研究了通过改变提示语言来导向LLMs观点的方法。

Result: 发现LLMs仅与少数国家的观点适度或过度对齐，而与大多数国家的观点存在不足对齐。改变提示语言以匹配问卷中使用的语言，可以比现有导向方法更有效地导向LLMs与相应国家观点对齐。同时，LLMs更与当代人口的观点对齐。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球范围、语言和时间维度上对LLMs观点对齐进行全面调查的研究，为理解和改善LLMs在多语言场景下的观点对齐提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转化为校准的正确概率，并通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型不仅需要决定回答什么，还需要决定何时不回答。现有方法在处理异构不确定性证据和提供风险控制保证方面存在不足。

Method: 使用温度缩放和适当评分学习轻量级校准头，支持黑盒API模型，通过风险控制的保形方法提供分布无关保证。对于长文本生成，通过检索证据监督原子事实性得分来对齐置信度和语义保真度。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强的长问答实验中，校准指标持续改进，风险-覆盖率曲线下面积降低，固定风险下覆盖率更高。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个从证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的可移植方案，无需微调基础模型，在分布偏移下仍保持有效，显著提高了语言模型的可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练后知识静态化，更新成本高昂。现有知识编辑方法要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下表现不佳

Method: 端到端推理链编辑框架，包含事实确认、相关性判断、选择性应用和最终推理四个结构化阶段，在单次处理中过滤干扰信息

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，Reason-KE将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳问答准确率提升至90.2%，在强干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%

Conclusion: Reason-KE建立了可靠LLM知识更新的新state-of-the-art，具有强韧性和高效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了检索增强语言模型(RALMs)的拒绝能力，发现LLMs存在显著过度拒绝行为，研究了不同后训练方法对拒绝行为的影响，并提出了改进拒绝后训练模型整体回答质量的有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型(LLMs)会产生看似合理但事实错误的幻觉响应。虽然研究者主要使用检索增强语言模型(RALMs)和拒绝后训练两种方法来缓解幻觉问题，但当前研究忽视了RALMs拒绝能力的评估，需要探究RALMs是否知道何时不知道。

Method: 研究通过三个问题展开：1)检查RALMs在不同内外知识状态下的校准情况；2)研究拒绝后训练对过度拒绝问题的影响，包括Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning和In-Context Fine-tuning方法；3)开发简单有效的拒绝方法来提升拒绝后训练模型的整体回答质量。

Result: 研究发现LLMs表现出显著的过度拒绝行为；In-context fine-tuning缓解了过度拒绝问题，但R-tuning放大了该问题；拒绝能力可能与回答质量存在冲突；开发的方法能有效提升拒绝后训练模型的整体回答质量。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了对影响RALM系统重要因素的更全面理解，揭示了拒绝行为的复杂性，并为改进模型拒绝能力和回答质量的平衡提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

TL;DR: MeVe是一个新颖的模块化RAG架构，通过五阶段设计实现内存验证和智能上下文组合，显著提升上下文效率并减少冗余信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用简单的top-k语义搜索机制，容易引入不相关或冗余信息，导致性能下降和效率低下。

Method: 提出五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、备用检索、上下文优先级排序和token预算，实现可审计和独立可调的检索与上下文组合过程。

Result: 在知识密集型QA任务上，MeVe相比标准RAG实现显著提升上下文效率，在Wikipedia数据集上减少57%，在更复杂的HotpotQA数据集上减少75%。

Conclusion: MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用提供了框架，通过精炼和蒸馏上下文信息，实现更好的基础支撑和更准确的事实支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

TL;DR: 这篇论文使用BERTopic和cTF-IDF权重技术对两个不同时期的工会（一为1920年代的制鞋工会，一为2010-2020年代的Unite Community）进行社区工会主义话语对比分析，发现他们在社会正义和内部服务方面存在显著差异，挖掘了社区工会主义在不同时期和领域的差异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是通过对比不同历史时期和组织上下文中的社区工会主义话语，探索社区工会主义的连续性和普遍性假设，以及现代NLP技术在历史劳工档案研究中的应用价值。

Method: 采用BERTopic进行主题建模和cTF-IDF权重技术，结合词频分析，对两个工会的话语进行定量分析，评估它们与社区工会主义关键特征（如联盟建设、草根参与、工作场以外行动）的符合程度。

Result: 研究结果显示两个工会在主题重点和话语连贯性上存在显著差异。Unite Community更符合向外对冲、社会正义导向的主题，而制鞋工会更加重视内部管理、工业关系和成员服务，体现了更传统的服务导向型工会模式。

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，虽然两个工会都涉及社区相关主题，但它们的参与模式存在显著分异，这挖掘了社区工会主义在不同时期和行业中存在连续性和普遍性的假设，同时也证明了现代NLP技术在劳工历史档案研究中的应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在大规模数据训练中往往捕捉到伪相关而非真实因果关系，导致在分布外场景下性能不佳，需要有效利用因果知识进行预测和生成。

Method: 提出CAT方法：1) 自动化流水线利用人类先验生成token级因果信号；2) 引入Re-Attention机制指导训练，使模型关注因果结构并减轻注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在提出的Spurious Token Game基准测试和多个下游任务上，该方法有效利用了因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAT方法成功将因果知识注入LLMs的注意力机制，显著提升了模型在因果推理和OOD场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了In-N-Out数据集，通过将API文档转换为结构化API图来捕捉API依赖关系，显著提升了工具代理在多工具查询中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，基于LLM的工具代理难以正确识别和调用API，需要更好的方法来理解和组织API之间的依赖关系。

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图，构建专家标注的In-N-Out数据集，利用API图进行多工具查询和组合式API调用。

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集后，工具检索和多工具查询生成的性能几乎翻倍，微调模型生成的API图能缩小90%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在RLHF后经常表现出过度自信，生成看似合理但错误的答案，这给可靠的uncertainty estimation和安全部署带来了挑战

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，从多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层间信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值，生成更准确的置信度分数

Result: 在多样化数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE显著优于现有基线方法，改善了校准性能

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用LLM内部隐藏状态来获得更准确的置信度评估，为解决LLM过度自信问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现句子嵌入空间中的几何距离并不能预测它们在各种任务上的相对性能表现，余弦相似度只能捕捉浅层的共性或差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索句子嵌入空间中几何距离是否能够预测句子嵌入在不同任务上的性能表现，以及不同句子嵌入方法是否以相同方式编码相同信息。

Method: 使用三种方法计算句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记嵌入和随机词嵌入，分析它们之间的距离与在语言任务上性能的相关性。

Result: 余弦相似度只能捕捉浅层的共性或差异，不能预测具体任务性能。语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的，而不是反映在句子嵌入空间的几何结构中。

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间的几何结构不能作为预测其任务性能的可靠指标，语言信息的编码方式比简单的几何距离更为复杂。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个检测AI生成现代中文诗歌的新基准，构建了包含人类创作和AI生成诗歌的高质量数据集，测试发现现有检测器无法可靠识别AI生成的现代诗，特别是风格特征最难检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成的文本已难以与人类写作区分。现代中文诗歌具有独特特征，AI生成诗歌的泛滥严重扰乱了诗歌生态系统，急需开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 首先构建高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人创作的800首诗和4个主流LLM生成的41,600首诗。然后系统评估6个检测器在该数据集上的性能表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有检测器无法作为检测LLM生成现代中文诗歌的可靠工具。最难检测的诗意特征是内在品质，特别是风格特征。

Conclusion: 提出的基准验证了其有效性和必要性，为未来AI生成诗歌检测奠定了基础，突显了开发专门针对诗歌特征检测工具的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT结合微调Transformer和图注意力网络，通过双流预测实现自动化作文分析评分，在ELLIPSE数据集上表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评分耗时且不一致，现有自动化作文评分方法使用静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文语义，且多采用整体评分忽略了语法、词汇等具体写作维度。

Method: 提出TransGAT方法，将微调Transformer（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3）与GAT配对，第一流生成文章级预测，第二流在Transformer词嵌入上应用GAT（边基于句法依赖构建），最后融合两流预测。

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上，TransGAT平均二次加权Kappa达到0.854，在所有分析评分维度上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GAT关系建模优势的潜力，可推动自动化作文评分系统发展。

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种高效的方法来计算词语之间的语音相似度，以便分析语言的语音结构特征

Method: 使用Needleman-Wunsch算法计算语音转录的相似度，用Rust实现并行化处理（CPU和GPU），构建全连接图并应用聚类算法

Result: 方法在处理大规模数据集时表现出高效性，GPU实现带来显著性能提升，成功识别出语音相似的词语群组

Conclusion: 该方法在分析语言语音结构方面具有可行性和有效性，且易于扩展到其他语言

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络的意图-语义联合建模方法(InSide)用于假新闻检测，通过将语义和意图信号建模为异构图结构，实现深度特征交互和对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征等），容易陷入表面模式检测，在动态环境中性能有限。本文从新闻意图角度出发，认为理解欺骗背后的深层意图比单纯分析表面语义模式更重要。

Method: 提出Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide)框架：1）将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构；2）通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互；3）采用粗到细的意图建模捕获整体和实现层面的意图；4）开发动态路径图对齐策略，在共同空间中进行有效消息传递和聚合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，所提出的InSide方法相比最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过将新闻意图纳入假新闻检测，实现了意图和语义的联合建模，能够更深入地理解新闻欺骗的内在思想，而不仅仅是表面的词语模式，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了chDzDT字符级预训练语言模型，专门针对阿尔及利亚方言的复杂形态特征，通过字符级建模解决方言处理中的形态学挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态、频繁的语码转换、多文字系统和来自其他语言的强烈词汇影响，使得传统的词级或子词级方法效果不佳。

Method: 开发字符级预训练模型chDzDT，在孤立单词上进行训练，不依赖分词边界或标准化拼写。训练语料来自YouTube评论、法语/英语/柏柏尔语维基百科和Tatoeba项目，涵盖多种文字和语言变体。

Result: 构建了多语言阿尔及利亚词典数据集，开发了专注于形态学的字符级编码器，为下游任务提供了有效的形态学表示。

Conclusion: 字符级建模对于形态丰富、资源稀缺的方言具有巨大潜力，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM的提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的人为产物而非模型固有缺陷，使用LLM作为评判者可以显著降低性能方差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的LLM提示词敏感性问题，探究这是否是LLM的固有弱点还是评估过程的人为产物

Method: 系统评估7个LLM模型在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12个不同的提示模板，比较启发式评估方法和LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法

Result: 使用LLM作为评判者时，性能方差显著降低，模型排名在不同提示间保持更高一致性，现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的更强

Conclusion: 提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的问题而非模型缺陷，LLM实际对提示变化更加鲁棒

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

TL;DR: 本文评估了基于Transformer的大型语言模型作为AI面试官在定量和定性研究中的数据收集能力，发现AI面试官在语音识别、回答记录和推理能力方面已超越传统IVR系统，但在实时转录准确性、情感检测和后续问题质量方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的大型语言模型的发展，AI面试官系统能够实时进行语音调查。本文旨在评估这类系统在定量和定性研究中的数据收集适用性，并与传统交互式语音应答(IVR)系统进行比较。

Method: 通过回顾新兴证据，从两个维度评估AI面试系统和IVR系统：输入/输出性能（语音识别、回答记录、情感处理）和语言推理能力（探询、澄清、处理分支逻辑的能力）。

Result: 实地研究表明，AI面试官在定量和定性数据收集中已超越IVR系统能力，但存在实时转录错误率较高、情感检测能力有限、后续问题质量不均等问题，使得当前AI面试技术的效用和使用可能依赖于具体情境。

Conclusion: 虽然AI面试技术显示出巨大潜力，特别是在定量研究方面，但在定性数据收集中仍存在技术限制，需要根据具体研究背景谨慎选择使用。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Motivation: 电子健康记录数据复杂且非结构化，传统机器学习方法难以有效提取关键患者信息，临床医生难以有效使用这些工具

Method: 将任务从序列标注重构为文本生成，使模型能够提供类似医生认知过程的推理步骤，并改进NER评估指标，整合BERT Score等语义相似度度量

Result: 显著提高了AI在医疗保健中的应用，提供了可扩展的解决方案，改善了从EHR中提取信息的准确性和可用性

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式AI和语义评估改进，能够帮助临床医生做出更明智的决策并改善患者护理结果

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

TL;DR: 通过弱监督方法自动提取和链接主诉中的医学实体，无需人工标注


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主诉记录形式多样化，医学标记不统一，难以标准化处理和文本挖掘

Method: 采用分割匹配算法生成弱标签注解，然后训练BERT模型进行实体提取和链接

Result: 在1.2百万实际主诉记录上进行实验，方法表现优于以前无人工标注的方法

Conclusion: 弱监督方法能够有效解决主诉实体提取和标准化问题，提高医疗文本挖掘效率

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

Motivation: 争议解决在税务、保险、银行、医疗等多个领域普遍存在，传统方式依赖人类法官，本文旨在探索LLMs作为法官助手来提高争议解决效率。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，首先识别争议的关键结构要素(事实、争议方面、论据等)，将非结构化争议描述转化为结构化摘要，然后使用多种提示策略和多个LLMs在三个层次上产生争议解决输出。

Result: 通过比较相关基线和合适的评估指标，评估了LLMs在所有任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的争议解决助手，在识别强势方、评估具体要求和论据强度等方面展现出潜力。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然擅长捕捉token级交互，但往往忽略层次结构模式，且在细微语义区分方面存在困难

Method: 采用双图编码器构建语义图（依赖解析和主题建模），使用图同构网络传播结构特征；设计分层对比目标，在多个粒度上保持一致性

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上显著优于现有方法，法律法规匹配达到86.7% F1分数（绝对提升6.2%）

Conclusion: StructCoh通过结构推理和对比学习的协同结合，有效解决了文本语义匹配中的结构关系和细粒度语义区分问题

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

Method: 使用34个标准化纵向牙周病例（包含258个问答对），通过开放式临床任务评估模型性能，采用自动化指标和持证牙医的盲法评估。

Result: DeepSeek V3表现最优，忠实度中位数得分0.528（其他模型0.367-0.457），专家评分中位数4.5/5（其他模型4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: DeepSeek是病例分析领域的领先LLM，适合作为医学教育和研究的辅助工具，具有作为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and

*Guangzeng Han,Weisi Liu,Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt是一个结合遗传算法和LLM的框架，通过将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟交叉和变异操作来增强合成数据生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型擅长生成合成数据，但确保其质量和多样性仍然具有挑战性。需要一种方法来产生更接近真实世界数据分布的合成数据。

Method: 提出Genetic Prompt框架，将语义文本属性作为基因序列，利用LLM模拟遗传算法中的交叉和变异操作。集成主动学习方案来优化父代选择，扩展后代搜索空间。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验表明：Genetic Prompt显著优于最先进的基线方法，在不同生成模型大小和规模下都表现出鲁棒性能。将合成数据与原始训练集融合能显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是生产高质量合成数据的有效方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

TL;DR: 指令微调显著提升大语言模型的长度控制能力，主要通过深层网络组件的专业化实现，不同语言采用不同的补偿机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在精确字数控制文本生成方面的挑战，比较基础模型和指令微调模型在英语和意大利语中的表现差异。

Method: 使用累积加权归因（源自直接对数归因）分析模型性能和内部组件贡献，重点关注不同层级的注意力头和MLP。

Result: 指令微调大幅改善长度控制，深层注意力头在英语中贡献显著，意大利语中最终层MLP起补偿作用，显示语言适应性策略。

Conclusion: 指令微调重新配置深层网络以实现任务遵循，组件级策略可能根据语言上下文进行适应性调整。

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

TL;DR: CRPO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过检索对比示例和分层对比推理来优化LLM提示，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽略了利用LLM固有推理能力从对比示例中学习的潜力。

Method: 提出对比推理提示优化(CRPO)框架，从HelpSteer2数据集中检索参考提示，采用分层对比推理和多维度对比推理两种优化范式。

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法，证明了对比性检索增强推理在自动提示优化中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究突出了对比性检索增强推理在推进自动提示优化方面的潜力，通过显式对比高质量和低质量示例实现更稳健和可解释的优化。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估基于预定义问题集的范式存在与目标交互有限、难度控制不足、评估结果有效性验证困难等问题，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 提出JudgeAgent框架，采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个步骤进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，能够提供准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架解决了传统LLM评估方法的局限性，为精确评估大语言模型的知识和能力边界提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了共模态检索增强生成(CMRAG)方法，通过同时利用文本和图像信息来解决多模态文档问答任务中的局限性，显著优于纯视觉方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限：基于布局分析和文本提取的方法只能利用显式文本信息，难以处理图像和非结构化内容；而纯视觉方法虽然能处理文档分割，但忽略了文本的语义优势，导致生成结果不理想。

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析，获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示；然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，在跨模态检索层面聚合结果；最后提示视觉语言模型基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应。

Result: 实验证明该方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉基础的RAG方法。

Conclusion: 将共模态信息以统一方式整合到RAG框架中是提高复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AMBEDKAR框架，通过宪法感知解码层和推测解码算法，在推理时减少LLM中的种姓和宗教偏见，无需更新模型参数，偏见减少达26.41%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM会反映训练数据中的社会偏见，特别是在印度语境下的种姓和宗教偏见，而现有的缓解策略大多以西方为中心，无法解决这些本地细微差别。

Method: 引入宪法感知解码层，基于印度AI宪法指导，在推理时应用；采用推测解码算法，让小型语言模型作为潜在偏见生成器，大型语言模型作为宪法指导的验证器。

Result: 相比基线，偏见绝对减少高达26.41%，无需重新训练模型，降低了计算和基础设施成本。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架有效减少了LLM在印度语境中的偏见，通过公平性推测范式实现了偏见缓解，同时保持了模型效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何通过元学习提升小规模解码器语言模型在低资源语言命名实体识别任务中的零样本迁移能力，特别是在内存或延迟受限的环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务通常需要微调大型多语言模型，但在内存或延迟受限的环境中不可行。研究目标是探索小规模解码器LM是否可以通过预训练实现快速适应并零样本迁移到未见语言。

Method: 使用一阶模型无关元学习（MAML）替换部分自回归目标进行预训练，在菲律宾的Tagalog和Cebuano语言上进行测试，这两种语言类型相似但在语法结构上存在差异。

Result: 在四种模型规模（11M-570M）下，MAML方法在仅头部调优时提升零样本micro-F1 2-6个百分点，在全调优后提升1-3个百分点，同时减少收敛时间达8%。最大收益出现在与Tagalog格助词si/ni共现的单标记人名实体上。

Conclusion: 元学习方法有效提升了小模型在低资源语言NER任务中的零样本迁移性能，表面锚点（如格助词）对于实体识别具有重要意义。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

TL;DR: 通过避免重复解码策略，在保持语言质量的同时大幅提升大语言模型生成效果的多样性，减少重复现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在故事生成等任务中输出重复单调、创造性不足的问题

Method: 提出避免解码策略，通过两个相似性罚分机制：早期重视念层面相似性以多样化故事概念，后期加强叙事层面相似性以确保自然多样的情节发展

Result: 输出多样性提升2.6倍，重复现象平均减少30%，同时有效防止文本退化，激活了更广泛的神经元

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效挖掘模型内在创造力，在不影响语言质量的前提下显著提升生成文本的多样性和创意性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Conclusion: FActBench为医学领域提供了有效的事实核查基准，一致投票方法能够可靠地评估LLM的事实准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks
and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain.
We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the
fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型的幻觉、偏见、隐私和高计算成本等问题，这些问题的根源在于将语言能力和事实记忆结合在单一模型中。

Method: 提出FLM范式，使用小型语言模型（1.35亿到320亿参数）专注于语言能力，将事实检索卸载到外部工具，并在语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识三个维度进行评估。

Result: 研究发现语言能力和事实知识都随模型规模增长而提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型规模与记忆能力关联更紧密。

Conclusion: 支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑的语言模型作为工具增强系统的基础，FLM范式为更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案提供了路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否不仅能推断人类思维模式，还能揭示团队对话中的盲点和成员间理解差异，以提升团队协作效果。

Method: 采用两步框架：首先使用LLM对团队任务对话进行共享心智模型元素标注，然后通过第二个LLM比较LLM标注与人工标注的差异，并定义SMM一致性评估框架。

Result: 研究结果表明，虽然LLM在简单自然语言标注任务上表现良好，但在需要空间推理或语音线索消歧的场景中会系统性出错。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在团队共享心智模型分析方面具有潜力，但在复杂推理任务中存在局限性，需要进一步改进以处理空间推理和语音消歧等挑战。

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在梯度消失问题，主要原因是固定的token级概率比裁剪边界和相同奖励的标准化，导致梯度更新无效和生成响应利用不足

Method: 提出动态裁剪策略优化(DCPO)，包括基于token特定先验概率自适应调整裁剪边界的动态裁剪策略，以及跨累积训练步骤标准化奖励的平滑优势标准化技术

Result: 在四个基准测试中取得SOTA性能，AIME24上Avg@1达46.7，Avg@32达38.8；AIME25上达23.3/19.0；非零优势平均提升28%，训练效率翻倍，token裁剪率显著降低

Conclusion: DCPO能更有效地利用生成数据进行大语言模型的强化学习，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

Conclusion: EmoPerso通过情感感知建模和自监督学习有效解决了人格检测中的数据标注依赖问题，并成功捕获了人格与情感之间的相互作用，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，大语言模型在处理外部标签定义时，主要依赖其内部参数化知识而非外部定义，特别是在通用任务中。虽然外部定义能提升准确性和可解释性，但模型整合外部知识的过程并不稳定一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否真正整合外部定义，还是主要依赖其内部参数化知识来解决任务。

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集（通用和领域特定）上进行控制实验，使用专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换的定义等不同标签定义条件。

Result: 外部标签定义可以提升准确性和可解释性，但模型整合外部知识的过程不稳定，往往默认使用内部表示，特别是在通用任务中；领域特定任务更能从显式定义中受益。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解大语言模型如何处理外部知识与其预训练能力的关系，模型对外部定义的整合既不保证也不一致。

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Motivation: 基础模型开发商发布了模型应遵循的行为指南，但缺乏系统性的审计来验证模型是否真正遵守这些规范

Method: 创建自动化审计框架，通过解析行为声明、生成针对性提示词，并使用模型自身作为评判者来评估一致性，重点关注提供商规范、模型输出和模型评判三者间的一致性

Result: 对6个开发商的16个模型进行了超过100个行为声明的测试，发现系统性不一致问题，不同提供商间的合规差距达到20%

Conclusion: 基础模型在遵守开发商行为规范方面存在显著差距，需要建立必要的基准来确保模型与其规范的一致性

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Conclusion: GRAM-R²可作为奖励推理的基础模型，支持下游应用如响应排序和任务特定奖励调优，在广泛任务中表现优异

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测方法忽视文本风格建模且依赖静态阈值，限制了检测性能

Method: 构建包含风格参考库(SRR)、风格感知路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)的MoSEs框架，动态确定优化阈值

Result: 平均检测性能提升11.34%，在低资源场景下提升达39.15%

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格感知的不确定性量化有效提升了AI生成文本检测的可靠性和性能

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言中语义评估的挑战，因为现有句子编码器在高资源设置中表现强劲，但在印度语言中的效果因缺乏高质量标准而未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了涵盖10种印度语言的新闻标题识别数据集，每种语言包含20,000篇新闻文章，每篇配有4个标题变体（原始、语义相似、词汇相似、无关）。使用余弦相似度对多语言和语言特定句子编码器进行测试。

Result: 多语言模型表现一致良好，而语言特定模型的效果存在差异。该数据集不仅可用于标题识别，还可重新用于多选题答题、标题分类等任务。

Conclusion: L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID数据集为印度语言的语义理解提供了重要评测标准，尤其在RAG流水线和LLM评估中具有广泛应用价值，并已公开分享。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared
publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp

TL;DR: 本研究通过AI技术重现了1931年Federico Pucci发明的基于规则的机器翻译系统，验证了其方法在近百年后的有效性，并将这一被遗忘的早期机器翻译先驱重新纳入历史视野。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在验证Federico Pucci在1931年提出的基于规则的机器翻译方法的有效性，并通过现代AI技术重现这一被历史遗忘的早期机器翻译系统，重新评估Pucci在机器翻译史上的地位。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci的原始方法重新翻译1931年文献中记载的两个文本片段：但丁《新生》的意大利语-法语翻译和伏尔泰《查第格》的法语-意大利语翻译，然后扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语的翻译实验。

Result: AI按照Pucci方法翻译的结果与94年前的原始翻译相比差异很小，验证了该方法的有效性。进一步扩展到其他语言的翻译也获得了一致的结果，证明该系统可以处理现代技术文本。

Conclusion: Pucci的机器翻译系统经过近一个世纪后仍保持有效性，应将其视为机器翻译领域的早期先驱，与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等人并列，这可能需要重新审视机器翻译领域的历史发展脉络。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的top-H解码方法，通过效果地结合模型信心度来平衡文本生成中的创造性和逻辑一致性。在创意写作测试中超过最新min-p采样25.63%，同时在问答数据集上保持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的截断采样技术（如温度调整、top-p、min-p）在有效结合模型信心度方面存在限制，比如min-p采样仅依赖单个顶部token作为信心度估计，没有充分利用概率分布信息。

Method: 首先建立了创造性与逻辑一致性之间交互关系的理论基础，形成了一个伪燃约束的最小散度问题。然后证明该问题等价于一个伪燃约束的质量最大化问题（ECMM），并提出top-H解码这种计算高效的贪心算法来解决ECMM问题。

Result: 大量实验评估显示，top-H在创意写作测试中比最新的min-p采样方法提升25.63%，同时在GPQA、GSM8K、MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持了稳健性。LLM作为判官的评估确认了top-H甚至在高温度下也能生成逻辑一致的输出。

Conclusion: top-H提前了开放式文本生成的最新技术水平，并可以容易集成到创意写作应用中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Conclusion: 领域特定的预训练对于代码混合NER任务至关重要，专用模型优于通用模型，但现代大语言模型也展现出强大的泛化能力

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在奖励信号稀疏和策略梯度更新不稳定的问题，特别是在基于RL的方法中，需要更稳定高效的训练框架。

Method: 将RLVR问题重新表述为监督学习任务，将结果奖励视为可预测标签，通过交叉熵损失优化策略模型参数化的评分函数，实现隐式的Actor-Critic耦合。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，PACS在AIME 2025上达到59.78%的pass@256，比PPO和GRPO分别提升13.32和14.36个百分点。

Conclusion: PACS提供了一个简单而强大的框架，为具有可验证奖励的LLMs后训练提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

*Tianjian Li,Yiming Zhang,Ping Yu,Swarnadeep Saha,Daniel Khashabi,Jason Weston,Jack Lanchantin,Tianlu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARLING是一个多样性感知的强化学习框架，通过联合优化响应质量和语义多样性，解决大语言模型后训练中多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型后训练往往过分追求准确性和有用性，导致输出分布变窄、多样性降低，限制了模型在创意和探索性任务中的实用性。

Method: 引入学习的分割函数来测量超越词汇层面变化的语义多样性，将多样性信号与质量奖励结合进行在线强化学习。

Result: 在非可验证任务（指令跟随和创意写作）和可验证任务（竞赛数学）上，DARLING均优于仅优化质量的基线方法，产生更高质量和更新颖的输出。

Conclusion: 显式优化多样性能够促进在线强化学习中的探索，从而产生更高质量的响应，证明了多样性优化对提升模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

### [137] [PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02550)
*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个针对LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域文化能力的基准测试，包含阿拉伯文化和伊斯兰文化两个子任务，结果显示特定任务微调显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于西方高资源语言数据训练，对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解存在明显不足，特别是在代表性不足的主题上表现更差。

Method: 设计了包含多选题的两个子任务：通用阿拉伯文化和通用伊斯兰文化，涵盖22个阿拉伯国家的传统、食物、历史、宗教实践和语言表达等广泛主题。

Result: 26个团队注册子任务1，19个注册子任务2，最终分别有9个和6个有效提交。最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，在伊斯兰知识上达到84.22%。参数高效微调是最主流有效的方法。

Conclusion: 特定任务微调能显著提升LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域的表现，参数高效微调是最有效的方法，而数据增强的效果则取决于具体领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，AMMKD在显著降低模型复杂度的同时实现了优越性能

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，验证了其有效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Motivation: 传统输入模态（Apex Frame、光流、动态图像）难以充分捕捉微表情的细微短暂特征，导致识别性能不佳

Method: 1. 提出MESTI将视频序列转换为单张图像同时保留微运动特征；2. 设计MEGANet网络，包含梯度注意力模块增强细粒度运动特征提取

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最高准确率，MESTI替换现有网络输入能带来一致性能提升

Conclusion: MESTI是优越的输入模态，MEGANet是先进的识别网络，为更有效的微表情识别系统铺平道路

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Motivation: 生成真实的稀疏多类别3D体素结构面临两个主要挑战：体素结构的立方内存缩放问题，以及由稀疏性导致的显著类别不平衡

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型来生成3D体素结构，将离散扩散扩展到非序列化的空间领域

Conclusion: 离散扩散是3D稀疏体素生成建模的一个有前景的框架，能够有效处理高稀疏性和空间一致性要求

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫SGLC的全局和局部特征组合框架，专门解决高分辨率图像去霜问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的协同工作，显著提升了高分辨率图像去霜的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有去霜模型表现不错，但对高分辨率图像的处理研究较少。实践中常采用下采样或切片处理方式，导致性能显著下降，主要因为集成全局上下文信息和局部细粒度细节的难度随分辨率增加而增大。

Method: 提出SGLC框架，包含两个主要组件：全局特征生成器(GFG)和局部特征增强器(LFE)。GFG通过全局场景理解生成初始去霜结果，LFE继而精炼局部细节和像素级特征，捕捉全局外观与局部结构的交互作用。该框架模型无关，可以与任何去霜网络结合。

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上的实验结果显示，使用SGLC后峰值信噪比(PSNR)显著提升，证明其在处理大规模图像霜敏现象方面具有强大效能。

Conclusion: SGLC框架通过全局局部特征融合机制，有效解决了高分辨率图像去霜的挑战，让实践者能够同时利用场景级线索和细粒细节，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

Result: 自监督方法在ROC曲线下面积达到0.62，负预测值为89%，表现超过随机水平。

Conclusion: 通过进一步发展，这种模型可用于排除正常切片，从而降低药物开发的成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PRISM标准化测试框架和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物识别信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在触视觉-语言任务中显示出显著能力，但经常推理和泄露敏感的生物识别属性，如种族、性别、年龄等，导致严重的隐私风险。目前缺乏公开的数据集或测试标准来全面评估这些问题。

Method: 提出PRISM测试框架，从两个方面评估MLLMs：(1)拒绝生物识别相关查询的能力，(2)一般回复中的隐式生物识别泄漏问题。同时对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现广泛的生物识别泄漏。构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性移除显式和隐式生物识别信息来保护隐私。

Result: 在PRISM上的评估显示，各种MLLMs在不同属性上都存在生物识别泄漏问题，揭示了详细的隐私违规行为。使用Safe-LLaVA数据集微调模型后，生物识别泄漏问题得到了实质性减少。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA数据集和PRISM测试标准为MLLMs的隐私对齐开发和评估设定了新标准，有助于减少多模态模型中的生物识别信息泄漏风险。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，该方法显著提升了动态环境中的推理和规划能力，为解决具身智能中的复杂任务推理挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using

TL;DR: 本文提出了FHT2SP算法，一种快速且高精度的Hough变换算法，通过扩展Brady的超像素概念并集成到FHT2DT中，实现了近乎最优的计算复杂度和恒定有界的近似误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有快速Hough变换算法在计算复杂度和精度之间的权衡问题：FHT算法计算效率高但精度随尺度恶化，而高精度算法计算成本接近立方复杂度。

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始2的幂次方约束），并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过适当选择超像素大小来控制精度。

Result: FHT2SP算法实现了近乎最优的计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持近似误差恒定有界且独立于图像大小，可通过元参数控制误差。

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了Hough变换中计算效率与精度的平衡问题，为各种应用提供了既快速又高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统常受噪声、材料变异和非受控成像条件影响，传统边缘检测器和手工流程效果有限，需要更精确的轮廓检测解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语言感知信息最大化(LIMO)损失函数，结合互信息、KL散度和交叉熵损失，在transductive few-shot CLIP设置中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot learning主要集中在视觉模型上，而在基础视觉-语言模型(VLMs)中的研究仍处于初级阶段。需要针对VLMs量身定制的方法来充分利用transduction的潜力。

Method: 提出LIMO损失函数，包含三个互补项：(1)视觉输入与文本类别描述之间的互信息；(2)KL散度惩罚网络概率输出与文本驱动的零样本预测之间的偏差；(3)基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失。同时探索参数高效微调(PEFT)策略。

Result: LIMO大幅优于最近的transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升。PEFT策略带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在transductive few-shot设置中调整模型参数子集的潜力，为VLM领域的transductive学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

TL;DR: MorphGen是一个通过显式建模核形态和空间组织来提升组织病理学图像领域泛化能力的方法，结合对比学习和权重平均技术，在跨域泛化和对抗攻击方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学全切片图像存在机构间的异质性（如制备、染色、成像条件差异），而病理学家依赖域不变的形态学特征进行诊断。受此启发，研究者希望开发能够学习对域偏移具有鲁棒性的癌症表征方法。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法：1）整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码；2）在监督对比学习框架中对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示；3）结合随机权重平均（SWA）技术寻找更平坦的最小值以增强泛化能力。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。该方法对图像损坏（如染色伪影）和对抗攻击表现出强韧性，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过显式建模生物学上鲁棒的形态学特征，成功学习了对域偏移具有抵抗力的癌症表征，不仅解决了数字病理学中深度学习的领域泛化问题，还增强了系统对对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Motivation: 大型多模态模型中视觉token编码导致token数量激增，显著增加计算和内存成本。现有剪枝方法依赖昂贵校准或次优重要性度量，导致保留冗余token

Method: 分析视觉和文本token的冗余差异，专门对视觉token进行剪枝。提出基于互信息的剪枝策略移除与文本token语义不对齐的视觉token，同时通过最大化嵌入空间期望成对距离来剪枝冗余视觉token

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上减少88.9%的token，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持强性能表现

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态模型中视觉token冗余问题，在显著提升效率的同时保持了模型性能，为大型多模态模型的实用化部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Result: 实验结果表明ILRNet在合成和真实噪声去除任务中都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，能够灵活有效地捕捉不同场景下的低秩特性，实现渐进式增强和优异的图像细节保留

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

TL;DR: SurgLLM是一个专为手术视频理解设计的大型多模态模型，通过空间感知增强和时间意识提升，在多种手术视频任务中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术视频理解研究存在两个主要局限：视觉内容感知不足和时间意识不够，这阻碍了多功能计算机辅助手术系统的发展

Method: 提出SurgLLM框架，包含：1）手术上下文感知多模态预训练（Surg-Pretrain）增强空间焦点；2）时间感知多模态调优（TM-Tuning）提升时间推理；3）手术任务动态集成机制高效处理不同任务

Conclusion: SurgLLM通过增强的空间焦点和时间意识，为多功能手术视频理解提供了有效的解决方案，验证了其在计算机辅助手术系统中的实用性

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Abstract: We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron
Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck
cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical

lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a

TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态大语言模型幻觉减缓方法VPFC，通过视觉潜在场检查和调整模型的视觉-语义关注，有效减少遗漏幻觉而不会增加虚构幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉减缓方法偏靠地假设遗漏和虚构幻觉有共同原因，导致减少遗漏却会增加虚构。这篇论文找到了两者的根本区别：遗漏来自视觉特征到语言表达的不足信心，而虚构来自跨模态表征空间的偏见关联。

Method: 通过视觉注意力干预实验发现了视觉-语义注意潜在场框架，并基于此提出了视觉潜在场检查方法VPFC，该方法能够检查模型如何构建视觉证据来推断对象的存在与否，并通过调整注意力分布来减缓幻觉。

Result: VPFC方法能够有效减少遗漏幻觉，同时不会导致更多的虚构幻觉，解决了现有方法的关键问题。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了当前幻觉研究中的重要误区，为发展更稳健和平衡的幻觉减缓策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化增强VLM的鲁棒性，在保持视觉理解能力的同时有效防御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活引导的防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能欠佳且可能降低视觉定位能力，需要更有效的防御方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段从多样数据源计算自适应层特定引导向量，在推理时抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化过程细化这些向量，整合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励。

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM通过激活引导和偏好优化增强了安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM有效平衡了效率和效果，为VLM提供了安全且语义基础良好的文本生成防御方案，代码和模型将开源以支持复现和未来研究。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了适配性点提示微调(APPT)方法，通过直接利用点特征微调多模态基础模型，避免了传统的"高到低"映射方法导致的空间几何信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于点云数据稀缺，预训练大型3D模型很困难。现有方法通过将预训练视觉模型映射到3D领域，但导致空间几何信息丢失，且缺乏通用的多模态适配框架。

Method: 提出APPT方法：1)将原始点云转换为点嵌入表示，聚合局部几何特征；2)使用排列不变性特征捕捉相对位置信息；3)通过与点嵌入模块共享权重的提示生成器，动态生成点提示，提供全局结构信息。

Result: 该方法能够以较少的参数量完成微调，直接处理点云数据，避免异构映射。通过点提示补偿异构数据缺乏结构上下文的问题，同时降低计算开销。

Conclusion: APPT方法为多模态基础模型适配到3D点云分析提供了一个通用的框架，能够保留空间几何特征，减少计算成本，且无需额外参数。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 基于温度模型的新题数据增帽方法NoiseCutMix，通过结合两个类别的预测噪声来生成自然高分辨率的融合图像，免除了传统CutMix方法的不自然边界问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix和MixUp等多类图像融合方法存在上下文差异导致的不自然边界问题，需要一种能生成自然高分辨率融合图像的数据增帽方法。

Method: 提出NoiseCutMix方法，在温度模型的生成过程中部分结合两个不同类别的预测噪声，利用温度模型的自然图像生成能力和CutMix的特征融合特性。

Result: 在分类实验中，与传统多类融合数据增帽技术、随机图像生成方法以及它们的组合方法相比，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix能够生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然高分辨率图像，为数据增帽领域提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

TL;DR: 提出了两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法UDAKD和FSKD，利用自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR的时空同步数据，通过2D预训练模型向3D网络传递知识，无需3D标注即可实现LiDAR点云的语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云语义分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时。而现实世界图像数据集丰富易得，希望通过跨模态知识蒸馏减少对3D标注的依赖。

Method: 使用预训练的2D图像模型处理未标注的2D数据，通过已知的2D-3D对应关系进行跨模态知识蒸馏，使3D网络输出与2D网络对应点对齐。采用自校准卷积作为域适应模块的基础，保留模态通用信息，过滤模态特定细节。

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态知识蒸馏方法有效解决了3D LiDAR点云语义分割的标注难题，通过利用丰富的2D图像数据实现了无需3D标注的高性能分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>

Motivation: 传统叙事分析需要将各种数据转化为手写叙事故事，给研究者和参与者带来沉重负担，需要更高效、参与者友好的叙事制作和呈现方法

Method: 开发了NAME范式，包含角色定位和形状模块来促进合理的图像生成，并设计了三维度评估指标来客观衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性

Result: 在不同数据划分方案下都表现出最先进性能：仅用0.96%数据就将FID分数从195降至152；在相同数据量下，70:30划分FID从175降至152，95:5划分从96降至49；新指标得分3.62超越基准2.66

Conclusion: NAME范式是推动叙事探究领域发展的首次尝试，能有效减轻研究者和参与者的认知负担，为叙事制作和呈现提供了更高效的方法

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁且突然的视角变化导致显著的物体外观变化和部分遮挡，使得现有方法难以实现精确定位。

Method: 提出Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG)利用类别token进行高级上下文引导和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT)通过增强查询多样性和模拟极端视角变化来提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能够有效处理自我中心挑战，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL通过模拟人类认知过程的方法，在自我中心视觉查询定位任务中取得了显著性能提升，为解决视角变化和遮挡问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数，实现超低剂量PET重建，在已知和未知剂量水平下均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和检查时间，但会导致噪声增加和图像细节减少，需要开发既能保持图像质量又具有灵活性的重建方法。

Method: DCDM模型冻结预训练扩散模型权重，注入核变换器约束(NTC)和编码连接约束(ENC)两个可训练模块。NTC利用核范数近似矩阵秩最小化，将低秩特性整合到Transformer架构中；ENC利用压缩特征表示编码和控制扩散模型。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，在未知DRF场景下也具有良好的泛化能力，即使在1%全剂量的超低剂量水平下仍表现优异。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数，提高了重建灵活性，在超低剂量PET重建中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Motivation: 全景视频在VR和遥感等领域应用广泛，但其广角视野常包含不需要的物体。现有视频修复方法主要针对普通窄视野视频，无法处理全景视频的投影畸变问题。

Method: 提出DAOVI模型，包含两个核心模块：1）基于测地距离评估图像空间时间运动信息的模块；2）特征空间中设计的深度感知特征传播模块，专门处理全景视频的几何畸变。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型成功解决了全景视频修复中的畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 通过视频生成模型提供多视角监督信号，能够丰富未见区域的细节并正则化化身表示，有效缓解伪影问题

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

5. 使大型模型（如26B）推理速度快于小型模型（如8B）

Conclusion: LightVLM通过双阶段加速策略，在不损失性能的情况下显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率，为大型VLM模型的实际部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在语义控制与生成管道的解耦方面存在困难，需要平衡语义可控性和照片真实感之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: Face-MoGLE为高质量可控人脸生成提供了强大灵活的解决方案，在生成建模和安全应用方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一个新的多实例学习方法，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力基MIL方法忽略了上下文关系，Transformer模型计算成本高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型虽然计算复杂度低但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 结合语义重排序（SR）对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和顺序排列，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块（SRSM）选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线实现了最先进的准确率，同时具有更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL通过整合语义重排序和语义引导的状态空间建模，在保持组织学意义和可解释性的同时，有效提升了计算病理学中的特征提取性能。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段存在的不同程度标签模糊性。

Method: SA-LDL算法通过分析锚点与所有其他年龄的嵌入相似性，发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式，采用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数。

Result: 在MORPH-II数据集上MAE为1.74，在FG-NET数据集上MAE为2.15，表现出竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL能有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特性，实现更准确和鲁棒的年龄估计。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Result: 在5个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证了EOIR的有效性，实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡，在保持相当精度的同时提供更好的效率和平滑性。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分离特征学习和光流估计，实现了更好的性能权衡，为解决大变形配准问题提供了有效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评测基准，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个标注样本，评测28个模型显示最佳模型准确率仅57.0%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评测基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，需要构建更全面的评测体系

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建高质量偏好数据集，包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组样本，评测三类多模态奖励模型

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o准确率57.0%，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B仅53.3%，发现RL训练不一定提升跨模态泛化能力，推理时缩放对多数模型有益

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准测试平台

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频数据爆炸式增长，现有方法只能检索整个视频而非活动粒度，无法满足复杂场景下快速检索群体活动的需求。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉时空演化特征；M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习整合层次特征，同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的时空视频哈希技术有效解决了细粒度群体活动检索问题，M-STVH通过多焦点学习进一步提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像存在风格差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有无配对图像转换方法未能有效筛选与下游任务最相关的风格特征

Method: 提出token驱动双流框架，包含数据视角选择合适目标token和模型视角识别最优目标token的双重机制，并注入辅助提示来匹配内容表示

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST框架通过token驱动的双重选择和内容-风格分离机制，有效解决了跨设备超声图像转换问题，提升了下游任务的适应性

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Method: ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC)方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，用于伪标签生成和蒸馏

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上仅使用one-hot API预测就实现了显著改进

Conclusion: ATGC方法有效解决了黑盒蒸馏中的分辨率敏感性问题，为实际AIaaS场景下的模型适应提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Motivation: 类增量语义分割中存在灾难性语义纠缠问题，包括原型特征纠缠（语义不对齐）和背景增量纠缠（数据动态演化），现有方法依赖视觉特征学习但缺乏足够线索来区分目标，引入大量噪声和错误。

Method: 提出语言启发的自举解耦框架(LBD)：1）语言引导的原型解耦，将手工文本特征作为拓扑模板指导新原型解耦；2）流形互背景解耦，使用多个可学习原型和基于掩码池化的监督进行背景增量类解耦；通过软提示调优和编码器适配来弥合CLIP在密集和稀疏任务间的能力差距。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在多步场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了类增量语义分割中的语义纠缠问题，通过利用语言先验语义指导特征解耦，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现出色，但在未校准模态（特别是MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向的差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出了"轻度到重度"的受试者内部生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估了BrainFM的有效性，证明了其在所有任务和输入模态上的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一个模态无关的基础模型，能够直接应用于五种基本脑成像任务，为解决医学成像中的模态差异问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有DiffusionDet方法在上下文依赖场景中受限于局部特征条件化，性能有限，需要更好的全局场景理解能力

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，使用交叉注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提案特征直接整合，通过专用编码器捕获全面环境信息

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中优于最先进模型，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: CAF框架通过全局上下文整合显著增强了生成式检测范式，在具有挑战性的视觉领域中实现了更好的细粒度目标检测性能

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架通过解耦和对齐策略有效解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移难题，为跨领域视觉语言理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at

*Aviral Chharia,Wenbo Gou,Haoye Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-SSM是一个新颖的多视角状态空间建模框架，通过投影状态空间块和网格令牌引导的双向扫描技术，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中存在两个主要问题：1）难以准确建模关键点的空间排列，特别是在遮挡场景下；2）容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置下性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出MV-SSM框架，在两个层次上显式建模关节空间序列：多视角图像的特征层和人体关键点层。使用投影状态空间（PSS）块通过状态空间建模学习关节空间排列的广义表示，并改进Mamba的传统扫描为网格令牌引导的双向扫描（GTBS）。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出强大的泛化能力：在CMU Panoptic的三相机设置上AP25提升10.8（+24%），在变化相机配置上AP25提升7.0（+13%），在跨数据集评估中Campus A1的PCP提升15.3（+38%）。

Conclusion: MV-SSM通过创新的状态空间建模和扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计中的泛化问题，在多个挑战性场景下显著超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Motivation: 首饰识别面临样式多样性的挑战，目前仅有专业人士能提供精准描述。翻译人员和口译员需要对首饰有全面了解，以解决查询和获取关键知识

Method: 采用神经网络和计算机视觉技术，通过三个不同描述层次来模仿专家分析，使用不同的图像描述架构检测宝石并生成不同细节程度的描述，构建了首饰图片数据库

Result: 经过详细评估，最终模型在图像描述任务上达到了超过90%的准确率

Conclusion: 该研究提出的创新方法能够有效地自动识别和描述首饰，为翻译人员和口译员提供了快速获取准确信息的工具，解决了以前仅能依靠专家知识的限制

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

*Yifei She,Huangxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合语义强大的锚编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务中的性能瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上表现不佳，主要原因是单一视觉编码器架构牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕获能力

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从无标签真实数据学习的挑战。现有方法要么依赖合成数据存在域差距，要么违反光度假设

Method: 引入Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并实施主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣天气合成数据训练的方法，甚至超过了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够灵活适应任务同时保持预训练模型的强泛化能力，为恶劣天气条件下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了视觉语言模型中批评模型和策略模型分离的传统，提出将批评模型数据集重组为可验证训练信号，直接在基础生成模型上进行强化学习，开发出既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力的统一模型LLaVA-Critic-R1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言建模中，批评模型仅用于评估输出而非生成响应，与策略模型完全分离。本研究旨在打破这种分离，探索批评模型直接作为策略模型使用的可能性。

Method: 将偏好标注的批评数据集重组为可验证训练信号，在基础生成模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-7B)上进行强化学习，训练出统一的多模态批评模型LLaVA-Critic-R1，既能进行偏好判断又能生成响应。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级批评模型，还作为竞争性策略模型，在26个视觉推理和理解基准测试中匹配或超越专门训练的推理VLM，平均提升+5.7%。扩展方法到现有强推理VLM得到LLaVA-Critic-R1+，在7B规模上达到MMMU基准71.9的SoTA性能。测试时自批评推理在五个代表性推理任务上平均提升+13.8%。

Conclusion: RL训练批评数据可以产生在评估和生成两方面都表现出色的统一模型，为构建可扩展、自我改进的多模态系统提供了简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的跨态融合Mamba网络(CSFMamba)，通过结合CNN和Mamba模型的优势，在降低计算复杂度的同时提高了遥感图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，导致模型长距离依赖关系时计算负担过重。Mamba模型虽然有低计算复杂度优势，但不能直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计了专门的遥感图像预处理模块，结合CNN提取多层特征，创造性地设计了基于Mamba运算符的跨态模块，完全融合两种模态的特征。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，性能超过了Transformer方法。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功结合了Mamba和CNN的优势，能够以更低的计算成本获得更好的多模态融合效果，为遥感图像分类提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图卷积网络(GCNs)在基于骨架的动作识别中占主导地位，但Transformer模型和掩码预训练框架为表示学习提供了新的途径，需要探索这些新技术在该领域的应用。

Method: 提出了CascadeFormer框架，包含两个阶段：1)掩码预训练阶段学习通用骨架表示；2)级联微调阶段针对判别性动作分类进行优化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(Penn Action、N-UCLA和NTU RGB+D 60)上评估，在所有任务上都取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: CascadeFormer证明了Transformer架构在基于骨架的动作识别中的有效性，通过掩码预训练和级联微调的结合，能够学习到更好的骨架表示，为相关研究提供了新的思路和可复现的代码模型。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

Motivation: 尽管投影层在视觉语言模型中至关重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估

Method: 将目标检测数据集转换为提示格式，设计训练/测试分割以确保标签集不相交，通过机制解释分析投影层的工作机制

Result: 投影层在未见类别上保持了79-88%的性能（相比已见类别），前馈网络类似键值记忆机制处理新旧标记

Conclusion: 研究提出了新的对齐泛化评估框架，表明即使没有显式对齐监督，投影层也具有非平凡的泛化能力，为有限对齐数据下的高效VLM训练提供了潜力

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Method: 通过计算VGG网络卷积层和Vision Transformer中patches和heads的特征图偏度，识别并减少与肤色相关的冗余通道，专注于病变区域特征，避免使用传统统计方法。

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法有效解决了皮肤病变分类中的肤色偏见问题，提供了一种计算效率高且实用的解决方案，有助于促进医疗诊断的公平性。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅依赖激活位置，解决了传统激活图可能误导解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活块往往只是与特征激活共现而非真正原因，这可能导致误解。

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，应用输入归因方法识别因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF图经常与朴素激活图不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系。块插入测试证实CaFE比激活排序块更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，需要关注真正的因果驱动因素。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Motivation: 传统视觉语言检索方法在处理描述抽象事件、隐含因果关系、时间上下文或包含长复杂叙述的标题时表现不足，需要理解视觉特征和潜在事件语义、上下文及现实世界知识

Method: 多阶段检索框架：密集文章检索（Qwen3）+ 事件感知语言模型重排序（Qwen3-Reranker）+ 高效图像收集 + 标题引导语义匹配 + 排名感知选择（Qwen2-VL），使用 Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) 融合多配置输出

Result: 在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge Track 2的私有测试集上获得top-1分数

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法对于复杂真实世界图像理解是有效的，代码已开源

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Result: 分类准确率和F1-score达95%，图像检索Recall@1为0.93，文本检索Recall@1为0.92，MRR分数分别为0.97和0.96

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了各架构组件的增量效益，证明该设计在低资源临床环境中具有鲁棒的多模态医学理解能力

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined
message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables
efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

*Bin Yang,Yulin Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对检测变换器在人类-物体交互(HOI)检测中存在的"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，提出了两种新的去偏学习目标，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测变换器在HOI检测中取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，即大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰和竞争，导致学习效果下降。

Method: 提出了两种去偏学习目标：1) "对比后校准" - 采样兄弟类错误HOI三元组并通过强位置先验重构为正确样本；2) "合并后拆分" - 先学习兄弟类别间的共享特征以区别于其他组，再显式细化组内差异以保持独特性。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在HICO-Det数据集上比基线提升了9.18% mAP，比现有最优方法提升了3.59% mAP，在各种设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 所提出的去偏学习方法有效解决了HOI检测中的毒性兄弟偏差问题，显著提升了检测精度和性能。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Method: 开发自动运动提取流水线，从45.8K个人-物交互视频中自动提取3D人体运动和对应文本描述，构建大规模数据集。

Result: InterPose数据集显著提升了最先进运动生成方法的性能，并支持开发基于LLM的智能体实现零样本的人与多样化物体和场景的交互动画。

Conclusion: InterPose数据集解决了人-物交互数据稀缺问题，为人-物交互动作生成提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Motivation: 现代人脸检索系统通常外包给第三方，存在严重的肖像隐私风险。同态加密虽然安全但计算效率低下，不适合实时应用

Method: 分层两阶段框架：1) 高吞吐量可取消PQ索引模块进行快速候选过滤；2) 细粒度密文空间检索模块进行最终精确人脸排序。设计定制化保护机制确保索引模块安全

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和安全性之间取得了良好平衡

Conclusion: Cancelable Product Quantization框架成功解决了安全人脸检索中的效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Conclusion: AAGLSD是一种高效且准确的线段检测方法，避免了复杂的细化策略，在精度和完整性方面表现优异

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Conclusion: 提出的图像到脑框架通过交叉注意力机制和扩散模型，成功解决了视觉假体脑编码阶段的生物相似性问题，为生成生物可信的脑信号提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniReason框架，通过联合建模动态3D环境及其决策过程来解决现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中缺乏时间维度推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，限制了自动驾驶系统的时空推理能力。

Method: 开发了OmniReason-Data大规模数据集和OmniReason-Agent架构，包含稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，采用时空知识蒸馏方法捕捉时空因果推理模式。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在复杂动态环境中的时空推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架为可解释、具有时间感知能力的自动驾驶系统建立了新的能力基准，有效解决了时空推理的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代推理增强检索能力，在知识密集型视觉问答任务中显著提升检索召回率和答案准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务上表现有限，传统单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积推理记录动态生成多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中迭代优化

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一个可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Motivation: 解决水下3D重建中因光线失真、浑浊和有限能见度带来的挑战，现有AI方法尚未充分利用语言模型与视觉处理的整合潜力

Method: 在多模态交叉知识框架下，为每个高斯基元嵌入额外语义特征，通过CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，采用语义一致性损失和分阶段训练策略（粗到细学习+后期参数优化）

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上全面超越现有方法，PSNR平均提升达3.09 dB

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，实现了语义和结构感知的高质量3D重建

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Motivation: 胎儿超声标准平面分类面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性等挑战，需要一种能够适应真实世界图像质量变化的方法。

Method: 使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床合理的对比度参数，通过可微分映射生成多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中融合这些视图。

Conclusion: 该方法通过内容感知的适应性能力，用物理信息驱动的变换替代随机预处理，有效连接低层图像特征与高层语义，为医学图像分析建立了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Result: 相比之前SOTA方法，SDM展现更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效的梯度基攻击方法，在对抗攻击和防御增强方面都表现出色

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合U-Net的局部特征提取和ViT的全局处理能力，配合Gabor滤波后处理，有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和鲁棒性，在噪声环境下表现优异

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用两步流程（先估计相机位姿再优化3D高斯），但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每基元SE(3)仿射变换，提出统一优化目标，并采用三阶段训练策略交替优化相机位姿和高斯参数。

Conclusion: 通过端到端联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊对动态3D场景重建的负面影响，实现了更好的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Swin Transformer和U-Net的混合去雾框架SUFERNOBWA，用于卫星图像去雾，在RICE和SateHaze1K数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像在大气干扰和雾霾影响下清晰度下降，信息提取精度降低，需要有效的去雾方法来提升图像质量。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer和U-Net混合架构，使用SwinRRDB模块在编码器和解码器中提取特征，结合全局上下文学习和局部细节恢复，并设计了包含L2损失、引导损失和新型分水岭损失的复合损失函数。

Result: 在RICE数据集上PSNR达到33.24 dB，SSIM达到0.967，显著优于现有方法，在SateHaze1K数据集上也表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减轻卫星图像中的大气干扰，保持结构一致性，在多样化大气条件下具有鲁棒性，在遥感应用中有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将单视图新视角合成分解为360度场景外推和视角插值的两阶段方法，通过全景扩散模型和视频扩散模型生成全局一致的新视角


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像新视角合成中由于大范围未观察区域导致的视角一致性差、长距离轨迹和闭环场景中视图对齐不正确的问题

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验；第二阶段从全景图采样并扭曲关键帧，在预训练视频扩散模型中使用空间噪声扩散过程生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在闭环场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和关键帧条件化实现了更好的长程视图和场景一致性，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FQAT方法，通过层冻结机制和自适应算法解决量化训练中的OOD泛化性能下降问题，在I.D和OOD任务上均优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法主要关注I.D数据性能，忽视了OOD数据的性能下降问题。实验证实QAT会导致显著的OOD泛化性能退化

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）层冻结机制缓解双优化目标梯度冲突；2）无序引导自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）设计梯度无序度量识别不稳定层

Result: 在权威OOD基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上均优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: FQAT通过关注损失景观平坦化，成功解决了量化训练中的OOD泛化问题，为可泛化的量化感知训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架(DRF)，通过结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量来解决基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI脊柱侧弯筛查方法主要依赖轮廓数据集，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性。姿态数据能提供更直观的骨骼表示，但由于缺乏大规模标注数据集和原始姿态坐标的离散噪声敏感性，基于姿态的筛查研究不足。

Method: 1) 扩展Scoliosis1K数据集创建Scoliosis1K-Pose，包含447,900帧2D关键点；2) 提出双表征框架(DRF)，整合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)；3) 设计PAV引导注意力(PGA)模块，利用PAV作为临床先验指导特征提取。

Result: DRF实现了最先进的性能，可视化证实模型能够利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取，并促进双表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查的关键挑战，数据集和代码已公开，有助于推动该领域研究。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活值并保留高分token来提升提示调优的准确性和效率，在11个少样本基准测试中显著优于CLIP


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功表明提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本

Method: 从样本级和语义级两个角度评估每个视觉token的激活值，只保留得分最高的token进行下游预测；使用类别特定的语义记忆库学习原型来精化选择；引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中，比CLIP最高提升11.19%的调和平均准确率，达到额外0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是提示调优中有效且可扩展的基线方法

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkVRAI是一个用于低光RAW视频去噪的新框架，通过条件化元数据引导和Burst-Order Selective Scan机制，在AIM 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光RAW视频去噪面临严重信号退化问题，由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致视频质量下降，这受到视频帧率要求的固有限制。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：(1)将图像去噪的条件化方案成功应用于视频去噪，显式利用捕获元数据来指导对齐和去噪过程；(2)引入Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制，有效建模噪声视频序列中的长程时间依赖性。

Result: 在严格且真实的基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能，为低光视频去噪设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过协同结合条件化元数据引导和BOSS机制，DarkVRAI框架在低光RAW视频去噪任务中取得了突破性成果。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态token压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述token作为视觉表示，根据语义密度动态调整压缩比例，在减少49%计算量的同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频token压缩策略采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型描述视频片段生成软描述token作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例（描述长度反映场景丰富度）。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs，同时保持竞争性性能，定性结果显示能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整token压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC模仿人类动态表达视觉信息的方式，实现了高效且自适应的视频token压缩，为视频理解任务提供了更智能的压缩方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但对多光谱数据的简单逐波段优化会导致几何重建不一致，尽管实际几何结构在不同光谱模态下是相同的。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1) 无共享结构的逐波段重建；2) 先优化RGB几何然后复制并拟合新波段；3) 联合优化（可选初始RGB阶段）。建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色分量中。

Result: 专用优化的联合策略在多光谱数据集上通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染展示了有效性，提高了整体光谱重建质量并通过光谱串扰增强了RGB结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在优化过程中何时以及如何引入光谱波段的关键权衡，为稳健的多模态3DGS重建提供了实用见解，建议直接整合多光谱数据到球谐颜色分量中。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

TL;DR: 雨天驾驶情况下，驾驶员视线聚焦更长、更频繁查看仪表盘，眼睛视线位置更高，表明认知负荷增加。这些发现对设计更健壮的驾驶监控咏助系统具有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雨天造成可见度和车辆降低，大大增加了道路事故风险。了解经验丰富的驾驶员在这种条件下如何通过视线行为调整视觉感知，对于设计健壮的驾驶监控系统（DMS）和驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）具有重要意义。

Method: 通过案例研究方法，分析驾驶员在清晴和雨天条件下在同一高速公路上的眼睛视线行为。采用两步聚类方法：先将视线点在10秒间隔内聚类，然后将聚类质心聚合成元聚类。结合马尔可夫迁移矩阵、固定持续时间、视线位置分布等指标进行分析。

Result: 虽然整体视线行为保持一致（主要聚焦路面，偶尔查看反视镜），但雨天条件下出现了明显行为变化：更频繁的仪表盘查看、更长的固定持续时间、更高的视线位置。这些变化表明驾驶员在不良天气下需要更高的认知聚焦度。

Conclusion: 研究发现了驾驶员在恼劣天气条件下的视觉注意力模式变化，为设计更健壮的驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）和驾驶监控系统（DMS）提供了价值过的视线模型引擎。这些发现对于提高道路安全性具有重要实践意义。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,

TL;DR: CompSlider是一种基于滑块的文本到图像生成方法，通过解耦多个属性来实现精确的多属性同时控制，避免了现有方法中不同属性间的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本到图像生成中，即使使用详细的文本提示，也难以实现对属性（如年龄或微笑）的细粒度控制。现有的基于滑块的方法通常为每个属性单独训练适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠，导致不同属性间产生干扰，无法同时精确控制多个属性。

Method: 提出了CompSlider方法，为T2I基础模型生成条件先验以同时控制多个属性。引入了新颖的解耦损失和结构损失，在组合多个属性变化的同时保持图像内的结构一致性。该方法在条件先验的潜在空间中操作，无需重新训练基础模型。

Result: CompSlider能够实现可靠和独立的属性操作，减少了训练和推理的计算负担。该方法在多种图像属性上进行了评估，并通过扩展到视频生成展示了其通用性。

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多个属性，解决了基于滑块的生成中多属性同时控制的挑战，提供了一种计算效率高且通用的多属性精确控制解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多种玻璃污染物对图像质量的影响问题，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的有效处理，为现实场景中的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

TL;DR: SpectMamba是基于Mamba架构的医疗图像异常检测模型，通过混合空间-频率注意力块和视觉状态空间模块，在保持线性复杂度的同时提升全局上下文捕捉能力，在多个医疗图像检测任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性。CNN感受野有限，Transformer处理高分辨率医疗图像计算成本过高。Mamba的长序列线性复杂度处理能力为此提供了有前景的替代方案。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力(HSFA)块分离学习高低频特征，视觉状态空间模块(VSSM)和Hilbert曲线扫描技术来增强空间相关性和局部依赖关系。

Result: 综合实验表明，SpectMamba在各种医疗图像检测任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医疗图像检测，通过频率-空间特征融合和优化的扫描策略，在效率和准确性方面都表现出色，为医疗图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了双向稀疏注意力框架BSA，通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对来显著提升视频扩散Transformer的训练和推理效率，在保持生成质量的同时实现高达20倍的FLOPs减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算瓶颈，全注意力的二次复杂度导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题。

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似度选择信息量最大的查询令牌实现查询稀疏化，通过统计动态阈值保留最显著的KV块实现键值对稀疏化。

Result: BSA显著加速了长序列DiT训练，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越了全注意力的生成质量。

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频扩散Transformer的计算效率问题，为高质量长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法的效率低下和时空上下文分离问题，在Posetrack数据集上表现优异且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法采用两阶段流程（检测+时序建模），存在时空维度分离、无法端到端优化、依赖复杂后处理导致推理效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：STPE（时空姿态编码器）、STDME（时空可变形记忆编码器）、STPD（时空姿态解码器），并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上超越大多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，有效利用时空上下文并显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互机制，有效提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式解决退化场景下布局到图像生成的上下文幻觉困境，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布局到图像生成在退化场景（如低光、水下）中存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐性弱的问题，主要归因于"上下文幻觉困境"，即前景实例被上下文主导的频率分布所淹没。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式（FICGen），包含两个主要步骤：1）可学习的双查询机制配合频率重采样器从训练集中提取上下文频率原型；2）视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程，并使用实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块来调节解耦和重建表示。

Result: 在5个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面 consistently 超越现有L2I方法，涵盖从严重低光到轻度模糊的各种退化场景。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景下的上下文幻觉问题，显著提升了布局到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种新颖的高斯参数化空间自适应标记化框架，使用2D高斯分布动态建模图像区域的位置、形状和纹理，实现非均匀图像标记化，在图像重建和生成任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同位置、形状和纹理的图像区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 使用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的区域，每个区域用2D高斯分布参数化（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）并耦合纹理特征。通过专门训练的transformer优化高斯参数，使用可微分渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务上，使用128个token分别达到rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过高斯参数化实现了空间布局与纹理特征的解耦，支持高效的两阶段生成，在图像表示和生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

TL;DR: MetaSSL是一个通用的半监督学习框架，通过空间异质性损失函数为不同像素分配不同权重，利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，显著提升了医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标注像素的异质性价值。作者认为有效挖掘损失函数中两个预测的丰富信息比特定参考预测策略更重要。

Method: 提出基于空间异质性损失的通用框架MetaSSL，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），使用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，并为不同区域分配递减的权重。该方法也应用于标注图像以实现鲁棒学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，当与现有SSL框架集成时，MetaSSL在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能。该方法即插即用，适用于大多数现有SSL方法。

Conclusion: MetaSSL通过有效利用预测中的不确定性和一致性信息，提供了一个通用的半监督学习解决方案，能够处理标注噪声并提升医学图像分割模型的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Result: 大量实验证明各组件有效性，性能超越之前最先进方法

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过利用多时间戳轨迹信息显著提升了多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的能力限制。

Result: 发现当前视觉编码器在识别MLLM应该关注哪些视频帧来处理给定文本查询方面存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来支持高效的多模态视频大语言模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景时面临空间分辨率低、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足的问题，难以同时保证动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文。

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列保证时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA，视频和帧级准确率分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，显示出卓越的视觉保真度和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: 该研究在神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间架起了重要桥梁，标志着脑解码领域的重大进展。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，显著提升了评估的精细度和跨域性能。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅从单一形状学习规范嵌入的局限性，需要捕捉整个形状集合的底层流形结构以获得更一致的点对点对应关系

Method: 使用形状图注意力网络构建共享潜在空间，通过宇宙预测器实现形状到宇宙的对应，同时在空间和频谱域表示对应关系，并引入新颖的循环一致性损失来强制对齐

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用形状集合的整体结构和双重一致性约束，为非刚性多形状匹配提供了更有效和鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比单视图自重建显著增加了预训练难度，使该方法在3D自监督学习领域超越了之前的单模态自重建方法

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于常微分方程和傅里叶变换的一体化模块FSS-TIs，用于跨域少样本分割任务，通过ODE关系建模域特定特征和域无关特征之间的频谱关系，实现了优异的跨域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域少样本分割方法通常使用多个独立模块来增强特征表示的跨域泛化能力，但这些模块之间的独立性阻碍了知识的有效流动，难以充分发挥它们的集体潜力。

Method: 提出FSS-TIs方法，假设域特定特征和域无关特征的频谱（包括振幅和相位谱）之间存在ODE关系，通过时间间隔序列上的迭代变换过程，同时对频谱应用带有随机扰动的仿射变换，将域无关特征表示空间的探索和多样化潜在目标域分布的模拟重新表述为ODE内在参数的优化过程。

Result: 在五个不同领域的数据集上定义了两组跨域少样本分割任务进行综合评估，实验结果表明FSS-TIs优于现有的CD-FSS方法，深入的消融研究进一步验证了其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE和傅里叶变换的一体化设计，有效解决了跨域少样本分割中的知识流动问题，在多个跨域任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端框架，联合处理激光雷达超分辨率和语义分割，通过轻量级架构实现与高分辨率64通道激光雷达相当的语义分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率激光雷达成本高昂限制了大规模部署，而低成本16通道激光雷达产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度

Method: 采用联合优化训练框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节，设计了新的SR损失函数关注感兴趣区域，使用轻量级基于模型的SR架构

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了与昂贵64通道高分辨率激光雷达数据相当的语义分割性能

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架有效解决了低成本传感器性能受限问题，为自动驾驶大规模部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Conclusion: PGRD框架能够有效学习医学图像分割的体素级分布，在保持强校准性能的同时实现实用的采样效率，优于现有概率分割方法

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，使用传统计算机视觉技术进行图像定位变得越来越具挑战性，但同时也更加重要。需要开发更可访问和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 方法通过结合开源多模态大语言模型与检索增强生成技术，使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集(EMP-16和OSV-5M)上构建向量数据库。查询图像在处理前会添加来自这个数据库的相似和不相似地理位置信息的提示词。

Conclusion: 这篇论文证明了基于检索增强生成的多模态大语言模型在地理定位估计中的有效性，为传统依赖从头开始训练模型的方法提供了一条替代路径，为GeoAI领域开启了更可访问和可扩展解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策解决方案，为资源受限环境中的轻量级多模态AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展

Method: 构建包含867,653个样本的混合模态数据集（2D X光/超声、RGB内窥镜视频、3D CT），使用生成式（MAE）和对比式（SimDINO）自监督学习训练统一视觉编码器M3Ret

Result: 在所有单独模态的零样本图像检索中达到新SOTA，超越DINOv3和BMC-CLIP；无需配对数据即可实现强跨模态对齐；在未训练的MRI任务上表现出良好泛化能力

Conclusion: M3Ret为医学影像社区提供了有前景的方向，是迈向多模态医学影像理解视觉自监督基础模型的重要一步，证明了纯视觉自监督对未见模态的泛化能力

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Conclusion: TPIGE框架在不需训练的情况下实现了独特的身份保持性能，具有强大的通用性和独立性，为文本到视频生成领域提供了经济高效的解决方案

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理部分相关视频检索时，容易受到查询歧义性和视频片段中无关内容带来的虚假语义关联影响，导致检索性能不佳。

Method: 提出RAL框架：1）将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模；2）引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度；3）可作为即插即用模块集成到现有架构中。

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RAL通过显式建模数据不确定性，有效提升了部分相关视频检索的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统体素网格在医学成像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而基于坐标的隐式表示能更好地保持复杂几何信息并支持形态学操作。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩算法提取胸腔的中轴结构。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相比体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式占用场为医学成像中的几何操作提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在处理稀疏数据和复杂几何结构时表现出明显优势。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Conclusion: NSD框架有效解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，提出的PSRL模块和基准测试为相关研究提供了重要贡献

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO是一个轻量级的多尺度感知度量，用于全参考图像质量评估，既可作为先进的图像质量度量标准，也可作为生成管道中感知优化的实用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不需要大规模人工标注数据集、能够准确评估图像质量，并且适用于实时应用的轻量级感知度量方法。

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过对多样图像应用可重现失真，并通过考虑视觉掩蔽效应的最新质量度量集合进行评分。在潜在域中结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略进行优化。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中优于现有度量方法，提供快速推理速度，在去噪、超分辨率和面部修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MILO不仅是最先进的图像质量度量标准，而且是生成管道中感知优化的实用工具，通过空间掩蔽和课程学习策略实现了高效且感知对齐的优化。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化的方法有效解决了扩散模型在变尺度生成中的关键问题，实现了更好的跨分辨率图像生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent

Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新颖的点云处理技术，通过将3D点云水平切片为多个2D数据批次，结合切片交互网络(SIN)保持垂直关系，在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度和减少参数量。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上比SAFDNet快1.13倍，参数量减少21%，精度仅下降1.2 mAPH；在nuScenes数据集达到66.74 mAP的SOTA结果；在Argoverse 2数据集快1.10倍，参数量减少34%，精度下降1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice通过创新的点云切片处理和SIN网络，成功实现了3D目标检测中精度与效率的优异平衡，为自动驾驶应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整训练脚本中的超参数，但忽略了分割网络内部超参数的调优，这限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 设计了自适应卷积模块，可动态调整卷积核大小；将该模块集成到MSA2-Net的多尺度卷积桥和多尺度融合解码器中，分别用于精炼CSWin Transformer的输出和捕获不同大小器官的细节信息。

Conclusion: MSA2-Net通过自适应的架构设计，在各种医学图像分割任务中展现出强大的鲁棒性和精确性。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,

image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: V²Drop是一种有效的token压缩方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了LVLM的计算效率，同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Conclusion: 整合异质标注和身体分割能有效提升模型性能，为3D医学影像中临床可靠、数据高效的可视语言模型设定了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，提高HIFU治疗期间的超声引导图像质量，将显著提升当前临床应用的治疗精度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡难题，视频的动态性和信息密集性使得视频理解成为挑战领域。

Method: 1. 慢快视频编码策略：基于帧间相似度动态分配计算资源；2. 四阶段渐进预训练：将上下文长度从8K扩展到128K token；3. 综合后训练流程：包括思维链数据构建、GSPO强化学习和对齐训练。

Conclusion: 该模型通过创新的编码策略、渐进训练方法和综合后处理，有效解决了视频理解中的核心挑战，为多模态视频分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，采用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，在相机追踪和3D重建质量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个无需相机内参的通用视觉SLAM系统，使其能够适用于各种不同的相机设置，同时降低模型复杂度并提高性能。

Method: 使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型作为前端，仅从两张RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点云图；后端构建包含闭环检测的Sim(3)位姿图来处理累积漂移。

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，在相机追踪和密集3D重建质量方面均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效、通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，在不依赖相机内参的情况下实现了优异的性能，模型复杂度显著降低。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit是一个统一的视频编辑框架，通过创新的对象失真控制信号(O-DisCo)和复制形式保护模块，实现了高效、高质量的多任务视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中需要针对不同编辑任务使用不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源，因此需要一种统一的控制方法。

Method: 提出基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号(O-DisCo)，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索，配合复制形式保护模块来保留未编辑区域。

Result: 大量实验和人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中超越了专业和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit提供了一个统一的框架，通过单一表示实现了多样化的视频编辑控制，在保持高质量的同时显著简化了模型设计和训练需求。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的新型编码器-解码器模型，用于同时处理双视角X射线图像，实现导管分割和3D力估计，在合成X射线图像上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型使用CNN架构处理导管手术中的触觉和视觉感知，但需要逐步扩展感受野。本文希望从新视角解决这个问题，利用Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer编码器-解码器架构，将两个输入X射线图像作为独立序列处理。编码器和解码器的嵌入输出分别输入两个共享分割头，回归头使用解码器融合信息进行3D力估计。

Result: 在具有不同噪声水平的合成X射线图像上进行广泛实验，相比最先进的纯分割模型、视觉导管力估计方法和多任务方法，该模型在导管分割和力估计方面都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的立体视觉Transformer模型能够同时从两个角度分割导管并估计其尖端3D力，为导管手术提供了更有效的多任务感知解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Panel-of-Peers学习框架，通过多个LVLM模型的同伴评估和迭代自我改进来免除对人工标注偏好数据的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法依赖人工偏好数据的高成本问题，机器生成数据质量有限，而自监督数据容易引入幻觉

Method: 模仿人类协作学习，构建一组LVLM模型组成的"同伴委员会"，通过迭代过程进行输出生成、评估和精炼，模拟同行审查机制

Result: 在十五个测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%，显著改善了模型性能，而不需要大量人工标签数据集

Conclusion: 同伴评估是一种可扩展的自监督对齐替代方案，Panel-of-Peers框架能够有效提升LVLM模型的性能和对齐质量

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型计算密集，few-step模型虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩的骨干网络，限制了在非数据中心GPU上的部署，且现有量化方法需要全精度校准。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；引入JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标进行细粒度优化，无需参考图像且只需少量校准提示。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID；大规模用户研究（超过80,000个标注）证实了在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成方面具有互补性，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了原版架构，移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能竞争力。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练，简化模型架构。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批次大小从2k增至8k，参数量可扩展至10亿以上，性能与原版相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级的纯生成式训练范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the

render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous

Motivation: 多光谱图像数据维度高且处理困难，多标签分类（每个图像可能属于多个类别）使特征提取更加复杂，需要研究降维方法的有效性

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2架构，在分类器前加入可选的PCA步骤将数据降至3维，然后输入三层分类器进行多标签分类

Result: PCA对多标签多光谱图像分类的有效性强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Motivation: 岩石粒度精确分类对岩土工程、采矿和资源管理至关重要，影响运营效率和安全，需要更准确的分类方法

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然提高了时间分辨率和降低了辐射剂量，但由于投影截断导致严重伪影，需要解决这一病态重建问题。

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型，仅依赖元数据（采集参数、患者人口统计和诊断印象）从噪声生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据生成高保真结果；两个阶段都使用ADMM模块在每一步采样中强制执行基于物理的数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，引入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下；相比无元数据基线方法，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上均取得更优性能；消融研究确认不同类型元数据提供互补效益。

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)和混合平衡信息瓶颈(MBIB)方法，通过损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术改进信息瓶颈网络，在长尾视觉识别任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉识别数据通常是长尾分布的，这给深度神经网络的高效训练和部署带来了挑战。传统信息瓶颈方法在处理长尾数据时存在不足，需要改进以更好地保留标签相关信息。

Method: 将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术集成到原始信息瓶颈网络中，形成平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)。进一步提出混合多个平衡信息瓶颈的结构(MBIB)，让不同的BIB负责组合不同网络层的知识，实现端到端学习。

Result: 在CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist 2018等常用长尾数据集上进行实验，BIB和MBIB都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的BIB和MBIB方法能够学习到充分且保留完整标签相关信息的表示，有效解决了长尾视觉识别问题，从信息论角度同时优化了表示学习和分类任务。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照控制方法需要大量领域特定数据集训练，限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。本文旨在利用现有生成模型的基础知识来实现实用的光照控制。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，然后使用分类器引导将目标光照整合到图像生成过程中。

Result: 在多种场景类型上实现了最先进的性能，在质量和控制方面表现出色，同时具有参数和数据效率优势。

Conclusion: 通过利用基础模型的知识，图像光照控制可以实用且泛化地实现，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

TL;DR: LGDiST是首个无参考的潜在基因扩散模型，用于处理空间转录组学数据丢失问题，在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，并提升6种先进方法的基因表达预测性能达10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法严重受限于数据丢失问题，现有方法依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，存在对齐质量依赖、外部数据集依赖、批次效应和继承性丢失等局限性。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，使用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富且具有生物学意义的遗传潜在空间，采用扩散模型框架，包含上下文基因、ST潜在空间和邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在基因表达补全任务上超越之前最先进方法，平均MSE降低18%；完成后的ST数据使6种先进方法的基因表达预测性能提升高达10%；消融实验显示移除任何关键组件都会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构相比其孤立组件实现了显著更好的性能，证明了使用上下文基因构建遗传潜在空间的有效性，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了强大的无参考解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Result: 系统评估了检测精度、计算成本和资源使用之间的权衡关系

Conclusion: 这项工作为CAV中鲁棒的联邦学习部署铺平了道路，提供了模型性能、系统级资源分析和环境鲁棒性的综合评估框架

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Conclusion: 这是首个将可解释性引入地理定位的工作，为地理决策过程提供了更丰富的语义洞察

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个针对多主体个性化生成的表示中心框架，通过显式语义对应和正交特征解耦来解决身份混合和属性泄漏问题，在4+主体情况下仍保持高保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多主体生成中存在身份混合和属性泄漏问题，主要原因是缺乏对多个参考主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的充分建模

Method: 提出语义对应注意力损失确保精确的点对点语义对齐，开发多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间防止特征干扰，并引入SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，现有方法通常在3个主体以上性能下降，而MOSAIC在4+参考主体情况下仍保持高保真度

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过表示层面的精确语义对齐和特征解耦，为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛研究，但无需额外训练即可进行提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持许多实际应用。本文旨在探索VAR模型的文本到图像编辑能力。

Method: 提出VARIN方法，引入位置感知Argmax反演(LAI)的新伪逆函数来生成逆Gumbel噪声，这些逆噪声能够精确重建源图像并实现与文本提示对齐的针对性可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明，VARIN能够根据指定提示有效修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN被验证为一种实用的编辑方法，为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的文本引导图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一模型在图像编辑方面表现不佳，主要原因是理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需要同时承担设计和绘制职责，这种职责分配不平衡限制了编辑精度

Method: 提出DIM数据集（包含DIM-T2I和DIM-Edit两个子集），通过冻结Qwen2.5-VL-3B理解模块，连接可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B生成模块，使用轻量级两层MLP进行训练

Conclusion: 将设计职责明确分配给理解模块能显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了职责重新分配的有效性

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

Motivation: 调色板作为创意工作流程中广泛使用的直观工具，在图像生成条件控制中存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性问题，需要一种更稳定的方法来控制颜色调色板条件生成。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，提供灵活的颜色变化控制；使用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调；在精心策划的数据集上进行训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter通过创新的直方图解释和控制参数机制，有效解决了调色板条件生成中的模糊性和不稳定性问题，为文本到图像扩散模型提供了更精确和可控的颜色条件控制方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是新生儿死亡的主要原因，特别在资源有限的环境中。目前的手动观察或侵入式传感器方法存在错误多、不实用和可能造成皮肤损伤等问题。

Method: 设计了一种基于嵌入式监测系统，采用量化的MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上进行实时行为状态检测。系统集成了三项关键技术：模型量化减少内存占用（68%减少）、Raspberry Pi优化视觉管道和安全IoT通信。

Result: 在公开早产儿图像数据集上达到了最高水平的准确率：睡眠检测91.8%，哭哭/正常分类97.7%。还进行了模型大小、推理延迟和诊断准确性之间的权衡分析。

Conclusion: 论文证明了轻量级优化模型（如MobileNet）是建立可扩展、低成本和临床可操作的NICU监测系统的最可行基础，为改善资源约束环境中的早产儿护理抓基了道路。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。本文从设计逻辑角度审视RMOT系统的安全影响，识别可能危及语言-视觉指代和目标匹配组件的对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出了VEIL对抗攻击框架，针对RMOT系统的统一指代-匹配机制设计攻击。特别发现了采用FIFO内存的先进RMOT模型中的新漏洞，通过有针对性的持续攻击可以在历史缓冲区中引入持续多帧的错误。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的综合评估验证了VEIL的有效性，精心设计的数字和物理扰动能够破坏跟踪逻辑可靠性，导致跟踪ID切换和终止。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明RMOT系统存在严重的安全漏洞，迫切需要为关键大规模应用开发安全感知的RMOT设计。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Conclusion: 合成数据增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但需要进一步研究来克服现有局限性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Motivation: 现有槽位注意力方法主要基于低级特征（如颜色、紋理）分配图像区域，缺乏高级语义信息，并因需要稳定的特征空间而无法细调编码器，限制了对象中心学习的灵活性和效果。

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch两个新组件。ContextFusion利用前景和背景的语义信息，通过辅助指示符提供额外上下文线索以丰富语义内容；Bootstrap Branch将特征适应与重构阶段解耦，通过自助策略训练特征适应机制，支持灵活调整。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，方法显著提升了多个独立槽位注意力模型的性能。

Conclusion: 新提出的两个组件有效解决了现有槽位注意力模型的主要限制，为对象中心学习领域提供了更灵活和有效的方案。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构性异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合的预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组成分支来显式建模物体组成图的分布，学习重要的语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组成图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组成图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

TL;DR: NOOUGAT是首个能够在任意时间范围内运行的多目标跟踪器，通过统一的GNN框架处理非重叠子片段，实现了在线和离线跟踪的统一解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线和离线多目标跟踪方法存在分割问题，无法满足实际部署场景中灵活的时间需求。在线跟踪器难以处理长期遮挡，而离线方法仍依赖启发式拼接。

Method: 采用统一的图神经网络框架处理非重叠子片段，通过新颖的自回归长期跟踪层进行融合。子片段大小控制延迟和时间上下文之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进性能：DanceTrack上在线AssA提升+2.3，SportsMOT提升+9.2，MOT20提升+5.0，离线模式下增益更大。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT成功统一了在线和离线跟踪范式，通过灵活的架构设计满足了不同部署场景的需求，在多目标跟踪领域取得了显著突破。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，提示对齐和图像属性是图像生成的关键因素，通过优化选择可以带来4.5%的PAR识别性能提升。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够有效生成适用于PAR任务的合成行人图像，通过精心设计的参数优化可以显著提升模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全向场景理解对下游应用至关重要，但现有方法局限于单帧分析，忽略了跨帧相关全景信息。需要建立跨帧全景VQA基准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 构建CFpano数据集，提出基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和定制奖励函数的多模态大语言模型，用于跨帧相关全景的鲁棒推理。

Result: 在CFpano基准测试中，所提方法在多项选择和开放式VQA任务上均达到最先进性能，整体性能提升5.37%，在所有主要推理类别上超越强基线。

Conclusion: GRPO方法有效，建立了全景场景理解的新基准，为跨帧全景视觉问答研究提供了重要数据集和解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于轨迹的新型测试时适应(TTA)数据集ITD，用于评估TTA方法在具有时间依赖性的真实场景中的表现，并提出了对抗性内存初始化策略来提升现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA基准测试主要关注分布偏移和i.i.d.假设违反，但缺乏对真实世界中时间依赖性的模拟，如视频流中连续帧显示相同对象的情况。

Method: 从目标跟踪数据集的边界框中收集目标中心图像序列构建ITD数据集，确保实例自然体现时间依赖性；并提出对抗性内存初始化策略来改进基于内存的TTA方法。

Result: ITD数据集能够有效评估TTA方法在时间依赖性挑战下的表现，新提出的对抗性内存初始化策略显著提升了各种方法在该基准上的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集填补了现有TTA基准在时间依赖性方面的空白，提出的对抗性内存初始化策略为处理时间依赖性挑战提供了有效解决方案，推动了TTA方法在真实世界应用中的发展。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid
Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network
(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习人群计数方法在复杂场景中面临区域密度分布差异大、视角变化和姿态差异导致的个体表示不一致等挑战，限制了计数精度。

Method: 设计双流网络结构：密度近似分支构建密度驱动语义图，表示近似分支构建表示驱动语义图，分别应用图卷积网络建模潜在语义关系。

Result: 在三个常用数据集上实验表明优于当前最优方法，在ShanghaiTech Part A和Part B数据集上分别达到MAE 48.9和5.9。

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过挖掘特征相关性有效提升了模型对密度变化的适应能力和多视角多姿态场景下的计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法主要针对自然图像设计，不适用于遥感图像的数据稀缺、复杂多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移等特性，需要专门针对遥感图像设计的OOD检测方案。

Method: 提出RS-OOD框架，包含三个关键创新：空间特征增强改进场景判别能力；双提示对齐机制交叉验证场景上下文与细粒度语义的空间-语义一致性；置信度引导的自训练循环动态挖掘伪标签扩展训练数据。

Result: RS-OOD在多个遥感基准测试中持续优于现有方法，能够以最少的标注数据实现高效适应。

Conclusion: 空间-语义整合对于遥感图像OOD检测具有关键价值，该框架为遥感应用中的可靠异常模式识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene

introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source

labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在空间关系推理方面表现不佳，特别是在处理不常见的物体组合时。现有方法通过模型微调或手工设计的测试时优化损失函数效果有限。

Method: 训练轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，然后将该分类器作为学习到的损失函数在推理时使用。采用双重反转策略解决分类器走捷径的问题。

Result: 空间准确性显著提升：FLUX.1-dev从0.20提高到0.61，SD2.1从0.07提高到0.54。方法能泛化到多种关系并显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: Learn-to-Steer框架通过从模型内部表示学习目标函数，有效解决了扩散模型的空间关系推理问题，为改进文本到图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly

*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ORDAC方法，通过标签分布学习动态调整序数分类中的噪声标签，显著提升模型在噪声环境下的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声，这会严重影响监督学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，而不是丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在年龄估计(Adience)和疾病严重程度检测(Diabetic Retinopathy)数据集上，ORDAC及其变体在40%噪声下将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49

Conclusion: 基于标签分布的自适应标签校正是处理序数分类中噪声数据的有效策略，能显著增强模型的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

TL;DR: 本文提出C33D方法，通过多视图渲染、适配文本-图像协调和多视图激散，实现了从3D模型和文本描述生成结构一致的新颖3D模型合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本/图像/3D到3D方法在整合多个内容源时存在纹理不一致和形状不准确的问题，需要一种能够生成结构协调的新颖3D模型的方法。

Method: 首先从输入3D模型渲染多视图和法线图，然后使用适配文本-图像协调(ATIH)生成新的2D对象，通过纹理多视图激散确保纹理一致性，并使用形状多视图激散提高形状准确性，最后重建完整的3D模型。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够生成印象深刻的3D创作，如鱼鲨(3D)-鲸鱼(文本)等组合，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: C33D方法通过简单但强大的方式，成功解决了3D对象合成任务中的纹理不一致和形状不准确的挑战，能够生成结构协调的新颖3D模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性，提出了MulSeT基准测试，发现仅增加训练数据无法显著提升空间理解能力，且空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面仍存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。本文旨在从数据和架构两个角度系统分析MLLMs在单视图、多视图和视频三种场景下的空间理解能力。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，设计了一系列实验来分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。从数据角度分析训练数据量对性能的影响，从架构角度分析位置编码在视觉编码器和语言模型中的作用。

Result: 发现空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限较低，特别是需要空间想象的任务。空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器的位置编码而非语言模型的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计来优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Motivation: 医学CT和MRI扫描中器官和肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力，基础模型在医学图像分割中仍表现不佳且存在领域差距

Method: 设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，在CT-3M数据集（387万轴向CT切片）上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: 该研究展示了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力，为医学影像分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and

achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注等噪声问题，影响模型性能

Method: 几何距离感知模块动态调整像素级权重，结构引导标签细化模块利用结构先验优化标签，知识迁移模块增强监督和对局部细节的敏感性

Result: 在6个公开数据集上验证，在Kvasir提升2.52%，Shenzhen提升22.76%，BU-SUC提升8.87%，BraTS2020提升4.59%

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效处理噪声标注问题，在医学图像分割任务中表现出优异的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Conclusion: 所提出的强化学习驱动框架通过协作蒸馏和自学习机制，有效解决了轻量模型在图像融合任务中的性能瓶颈，为多模态图像融合提供了新的训练范式

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

Motivation: 现有美妆试用方法无法有效分离半透明化妆与皮肤颜色，导致身份偏移和公平性问题，且缺乏实时能力和时间一致性。

Method: 将美妆转移解耦为两步：透明化妆提取和图形渲染。使用图形渲染流水线和无监督k-means聚类生成伪真实数据训练模型，采用专门的训练目标包括alpha权重重建和唇彩损失。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，为高保真度、身份保持的美妆转移提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式视频合成方法成功自动化了传统视频制作流程，为视频创作提供了高效的新途径

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，用于解决医学图像中传统位置编码在处理各向异性高维数据时的局限性，在多个医学影像任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中复杂的器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统Transformer位置编码(如正弦位置编码SPE和各向同性傅里叶特征IFPE)表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像特点设计位置编码方法。

Method: 提出了各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，这是IFPE的泛化版本，能够整合各向异性、类别特异性和领域特异性的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务中，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据特性和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or

effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合模态联邦学习框架MDM-MixMFL，通过模态解耦策略和模态记忆机制解决分布式MRI图像分割中的模态异构性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法主要采用集中式多模态范式，不适用于工程中的非集中式混合模态医疗场景，存在客户端模态异构性和数据异构性问题

Method: MDM-MixMFL框架包含模态解耦策略（将模态分解为模态特定和模态共享信息）和模态记忆机制（动态存储客户端共享模态原型）

Result: 在两个公共MRI图像分割数据集上的大量实验证明了方法的有效性和优越性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理分布式客户端中的混合模态MRI图像分割问题，解决了模态异构性挑战

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR是一个完全无监督的多目标发现方法，通过运动分割生成高质量伪标签来改进DINOSAUR模型，无需人工监督即可在视频中检测和定位多个对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标发现方法虽然利用视频运动线索，但仍需要监督生成伪标签来训练对象中心学习模型。本文旨在开发一个完全无监督的方法来解决这一局限性。

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割，生成高质量伪标签来精炼slot表示，并训练slot停用模块区分前景和背景。

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上取得了强大的多目标发现结果，性能优于之前的state-of-the-art方法，尽管是完全无监督的。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR证明了即使概念简单，通过运动精炼和伪标签生成，完全无监督的方法也能在多目标发现任务中取得优异性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: token合并技术为可扩展的3D视觉系统提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent
challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced
spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets
remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and
evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech.
We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative
data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance
despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective
model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the
combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1
score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging
pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby
paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed spoken dialog
systems, yet the optimal architecture for real-time on-device voice agents
remains an open question. While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical
advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language
understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing
latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that
overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and
streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational
speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c)
text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling.
Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac
Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete
on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can
overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path
forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation
metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy
Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed)
established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite
this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a
significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated
pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection
of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using
our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript
verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K
annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error
detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed
rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a
two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long
vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We
further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model
which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We
release all code, data, and models as open-source:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题的语音合成方法，用深度学习模型直接从语音生成离散标签，取代传统的字符到音素转换方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的G2P转换需要手工语音注释，成本高且扩展性差。这种方法可以减少对人工注释的依赖，特别是对大规模未注释音频数据集更具扩展性。

Method: 利用预训练的语音SSL模型，训练T5编码器从混合脚本文本（如汉字和假名）生成伪语言标签。这种方法避免了手动语音注释的需求。

Result: 该模型的性能与传统G2P基础的文本语音合成系统相当，能够合成保留自然语言和超语言特征（如口音和语调）的语音。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种替代传统G2P转换的有效方法，能够大大降低语音合成系统的构建成本和复杂性，同时保持高质量的语音输出。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute
the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep
learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech.
Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce
pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and
Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription,
reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed
audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based
text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains
natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and
intonations.

Conclusion: Traj-MLLM首次证明了MLLM在轨迹数据挖掘中的有效性，无需训练数据或模型微调即可实现跨区域和跨任务的通用轨迹分析，为解决轨迹分析泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across
different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet
important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from
the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for
specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs
reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due
to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal
trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain
the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}},
which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By
integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories
into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal
characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for
trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to
finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on
four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on
travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and
transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves
these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning
the MLLM backbones.

Conclusion: LGSRR方法通过利用LLM的知识增强小模型的关系推理性能，有效解决了复杂意图理解中的语义关系推理问题，为多模态人类行为分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing
human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world
scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their
modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained
semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel
LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the
expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic
foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.
Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained
semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks
semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.
Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations
grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable
more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent
and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse
semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at

Motivation: 相变材料的功能性质受到纳米级组成和结构异质性的强烈影响，但传统技术难以解析这些微观特征。

Method: 采用无监督机器学习流程：首先进行PCA降维，然后使用t-SNE和UMAP进行群集验证，最后通过k-means群集和彩虹评分进行优化。

Result: 识别出四个明确群集：群集1含有氧和锌富集，群集2含钼富集，群集3含镜富集，群集4再次含锌富集。平均行射图谅证了结构异质性。

Conclusion: 群集分析提供了强大框架，能够关联相变材料的局部化学和结构特征，为理解其内在异质性提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文件具有领域特定的语言特点且标注数据有限，传统文本分类方法在处理这类文档时面临挑战，需要结合语义和结构信息来改善分类效果。

Method: 使用Top2Vec学习语义文档嵌入并自动发现潜在主题，同时使用Node2Vec通过二分图捕获法律文档的结构关系，然后将两种嵌入结合并使用KMeans进行聚类。

Result: 实验表明Top2Vec+Node2Vec组合方法在聚类质量上优于仅使用文本或图嵌入的方法，性能优于基线LDA和NMF模型，但对初始主题生成质量和嵌入模型表示能力敏感。

Conclusion: 该方法在法律数据探索性分析和监督学习任务预处理方面具有潜力，但需要进一步优化领域特定嵌入、超参数调优和人工验证，才能在实际法律应用中发挥作用。

Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their
domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a
hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and
graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic
document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to
capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The
embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings
of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the
combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only
or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters,
such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative
approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic
modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the
quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the
chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic
recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of
cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance
legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for
exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks
but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical
legal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理复杂移动任务时面临应用特定知识有限的问题，UI转换图虽然提供了结构化导航表示但未被充分利用

Method: 将碎片化的UI转换图转换为结构化向量数据库，采用意图引导的LLM搜索方法生成可操作的导航路径

Result: 在多个移动应用中实现75.8%的成功率（比AutoDroid提升8.9%）、84.6%的决策准确率（提升8.1%），平均任务步骤从4.5减少到4.1

Conclusion: KG-RAG框架有效提升了GUI代理的性能，可扩展到网页/桌面环境，并提供了适用于中国移动生态系统的基准测试集

Abstract: Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited
app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured
navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and
inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into
structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an
intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths,
enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show
that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9%
improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and
reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present
KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese
mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop
(+40% SR on Weibo-web; +20% on QQ Music-desktop), and a UTG cost ablation shows
accuracy saturates at ~4h per complex app, enabling practical deployment

*Mingxuan Cui,Yilan Jiang,Duo Zhou,Cheng Qian,Yuji Zhang,Qiong Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ShortageSim是首个基于大语言模型的多智能体仿真框架，用于模拟药品短缺情况下制药商、采购机构和监管机构之间的复杂战略互动，相比传统模型能更好地处理信息不对称和有限理性决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药品短缺对患者护理和医疗系统构成严重风险，但由于制药供应链中存在根本性的信息不对称问题，监管干预措施的有效性一直难以评估。

Method: 开发了基于大语言模型的多智能体仿真框架ShortageSim，通过序列化生产游戏模拟FDA短缺警报在供应链中的传播，以及对企业产能投资和采购决策的影响。

Result: 在历史短缺事件上的实验表明，ShortageSim将停产披露案例的解决延迟百分比降低了83%，使模拟持续时间更接近真实情况。

Conclusion: ShortageSim为设计和测试复杂信息稀缺供应链中的干预措施提供了一个新颖的计算框架，并开源了框架和包含2925个FDA短缺事件的数据集。

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at
https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel
computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex,
information-scarce supply chains.

### [361] [Data Cartography for Detecting Memorization Hotspots and Guiding Data Interventions in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00083)
*Laksh Patel,Neel Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenDataCarto框架通过难度分数和记忆分数对预训练数据进行分类，指导针对性数据修剪和权重调整，有效减少数据泄露同时保持生成性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的风险，这些记忆可能被攻击者提取或夸大基准性能，需要数据中心的解决方案来缓解这一问题

Method: 提出生成数据制图(GenDataCarto)框架，为每个预训练样本分配难度分数(早期epoch损失)和记忆分数(遗忘事件频率)，将样本划分为四个象限来指导针对性修剪和权重调整

Result: 在仅修剪10%数据的情况下，将合成canary提取成功率降低40%以上，同时验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%

Conclusion: 基于原则的数据干预可以显著减少数据泄露，同时对生成性能影响极小，证明了数据中心方法在缓解生成模型记忆问题上的有效性

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Self-Refinement (GSR)框架，通过并行生成候选答案并进行自我优化，提升大语言模型解决复杂推理问题的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法如Best-of-N和多数投票的性能受限于候选答案质量，且无法在所有候选答案都错误时产生正确解。引入额外模型选择最佳答案会带来显著部署成本

Method: GSR框架：统一模型并行生成候选答案，然后基于问题和候选答案进行自我优化合成新解决方案。设计了混合训练管道，联合优化直接解决问题和优化候选答案两个互补目标

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能。学习的自我优化技能具有模型无关性，在不同模型规模上表现稳健，并能泛化到分布外推理任务

Conclusion: GSR框架通过自我优化机制有效提升了LLMs解决复杂推理问题的能力，避免了传统方法的局限性，具有很好的泛化性和实用性

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文发现神经网络剪枝会破坏LLM内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，提出了TPLO方法通过关注激活异常值和判别性特征来保持剪枝后模型的谎言检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法虽然能保持下游任务性能，但会破坏模型内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，这在实际部署中可能带来安全隐患。

Method: 提出TPLO方法，通过重点关注具有更多激活异常值和更强判别性特征的层，同时引入新的提示规则来丰富TruthfulQA基准测试。

Result: 在50%稀疏度下达到88%的幻觉检测准确率，同时提升了在TruthfulQA基准上的性能表现。

Conclusion: TPLO方法成功解决了剪枝过程中谎言检测能力下降的问题，为在资源受限环境下安全部署LLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了先进谱聚类(ASC)方法，整合数值财务数据和文本数据的相似性，通过优化权重参数和特征向量选择，在中小企业信用监测中实现比基线方法高18%的轮廓分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构数据（数值财务变量和文本记录）给信用监测带来重大挑战，需要开发能够同时处理这两种数据类型的方法来提升聚类效果和可解释性。

Method: ASC方法通过优化权重参数整合财务和文本相似性，采用新颖的特征值-轮廓优化方法选择特征向量，并在k-means、k-medians、k-medoids等多种聚类算法上验证鲁棒性。

Result: 在1,428家中小企业数据集上，ASC的轮廓分数比单类型数据基线方法高18%，识别出51%的低风险企业包含'社会招聘'术语，招聘导向型中小企业违约风险低30%。

Conclusion: ASC通过将谱聚类理论与异构数据应用相结合，能够识别有意义的聚类模式，为更有针对性和有效的信用干预提供支持，具有很好的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次成本的交叉令牌混合，同时保持轻量级线性更新，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在所有层对所有令牌统一应用二次自注意力，计算成本高昂。需要一种更高效的架构来减少计算开销，同时保持性能。

Method: 引入动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，减少大多数令牌的注意力成本至线性。通过路由机制，只有约10%的令牌通过注意力处理。

Result: DTRNet在保持与完整Transformer相当性能的同时，显著降低FLOPs。在匹配FLOPs下，比MoD和D-LLM等路由方法在准确性和内存方面表现更好，且效率随序列长度增加而提升。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过解耦令牌更新和注意力混合，大幅减少二次计算份额，为Transformer提供了简单、高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

TL;DR: MEPT是一种基于专家混合架构的提示调优方法，通过集成多个提示专家来自适应学习多样化和非平稳的数据分布，在SuperGLUE上取得了显著性能提升并大幅减少激活提示数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法在参数空间上过于刚性，无法动态激活适当的神经通路来灵活适应多样化和不断变化的数据分布。

Method: 提出Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT)框架，利用专家混合架构集成多个提示专家，自适应学习不同数据分布。

Result: 在SuperGLUE上优于多个参数高效基线方法，平均准确率提升1.94%，同时激活提示数量减少79.25%。

Conclusion: MEPT作为一种有效的流形映射框架，通过理论分析和神经激活通路可视化验证了其有效性，为灵活适应多样化数据分布提供了新思路。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的强化学习验证奖励方法需要大量计算资源和数据集，导致训练成本高且数据效率低

Method: 结合离线数据选择（基于多样性、影响力和适当难度）和在线数据选择（基于样本级可探索性指标动态过滤低潜力样本），并加入回放机制确保充分训练

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中均优于现有方法，仅用20%训练数据就在AIME24上实现1.85倍加速，在AIME25上实现1.66倍加速

Conclusion: DEPO通过高效的数据选择策略显著提高了RLVR训练的数据效率和计算效率，为大规模推理模型的训练提供了更经济的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估数据集复杂性对于知识图谱链接预测模型的比较至关重要，需要验证CSG指标在该领域的实际有效性

Method: 在标准知识图谱链接预测基准上系统评估CSG指标，分析其两个关键参数(M和K)的影响，并与MRR等性能指标进行相关性分析

Result: CSG对K参数选择高度敏感，无法随类别数量自然扩展；与MRR等性能指标相关性弱或无相关性；在链接预测场景中原有的稳定性和预测能力失效

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要开发更鲁棒、分类器无关的复杂性度量方法来进行知识图谱链接预测评估

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监护模型如LlamaGuard只能检测预定义的静态害害类别，无法满足不同应用域的客戶化需求。需要一种能够根据用户自定义政策进行动态评估的监护模型。

Method: 提出动态监护模型，支持两种使用方式：快速检测政策违规，以及链式思维推理模式（说明并证明模型输出）。该模型能够根据用户自定义的自由形式政策来评估文本。

Result: 动态监护模型在静态害害类别检测上与标准静态模型准确性相当，同时在自由形式政策违规检测上达到了前沿推理模型的准确性水平，但耗时更短。

Conclusion: 动态监护模型提供了一种灵活的解决方案，能够根据用户特定需求进行政策执行，在保持高准确性的同时提高了效率，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的高效扩散模型采样框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，在极低函数评估次数（如5次）下显著提升生成质量和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各模态生成任务中表现优异，但由于其固有的迭代采样过程导致计算成本高昂。现有的无训练加速方法受限于底层采样轨迹的低效性

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架：1）将预训练扩散模型的采样轨迹重新参数化为流匹配形式；2）采用自适应速度分解机制，将速度场分解为线性漂移项和残差分量；3）主动抑制残差分量的时间变化，恢复高阶积分的精度优势

Result: 在条件图像生成和文本到图像合成任务中，A-FloPS在样本质量和效率方面均优于最先进的无训练采样器。仅用5次函数评估即可实现显著更低的FID分数，生成更清晰、更连贯的图像

Conclusion: A-FloPS为高质量、低延迟生成建模提供了一个通用有效的解决方案，其自适应机制还能改进基于流的原生生成模型，展现出良好的通用性

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光网络故障管理中机器学习方法面临严重的类别不平衡问题，正常实例远多于故障案例，而后处理方法在这一领域尚未得到充分研究

Method: 使用实验数据集对预处理、处理中和后处理三种类别不平衡缓解方法进行直接比较，包括阈值调整、随机欠采样、SMOTE过采样、元学习和生成式AI等方法

Result: 故障检测中后处理方法（特别是阈值调整）F1分数提升最高达15.3%；故障识别中生成式AI方法性能提升最大达24.2%；存在类别重叠且延迟关键时，SMOTE等过采样方法最有效；无延迟约束时元学习效果最佳；低重叠场景中生成式AI方法性能最高且推理时间最短

Conclusion: 不同场景下需要选择不同的类别不平衡处理方法：后处理适合故障检测，生成式AI适合故障识别，过采样适合有延迟约束的重叠场景，元学习适合无约束情况，生成式AI在低重叠场景中综合表现最佳

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Motivation: STE方法忽视了连续值与量化值之间的进制化误差，导致极低位宽情况下的准确性下降

Method: 提出PEGE方法，采用对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，将QAT形成为预测损失和量化误差的同时优化问题

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，基于ResNet、VGG等网络结构，PEGE方法持续超过现有反向传播方法，让低精度模型达到或超过全精度模型的准确性

Conclusion: PEGE提供了一种统一且可通用的框架，能够有效解决STE在极低位宽量化中的局限性，为资源受限硬件上深度神经网络的部署提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Conclusion: IMST模型不仅准确率更高，还具有更好的可解释性和计算效率，结构更精简，风险检测能力更强

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

TL;DR: FoRo是一种无梯度、仅前向传播的持续学习方法，通过CMA-ES优化提示嵌入和知识编码矩阵，显著减少遗忘并提高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法依赖反向传播和梯度优化，计算密集且不适合资源受限环境

Method: 轻量级提示调优策略（输入层插入提示嵌入，使用CMA-ES优化）+ 知识编码机制（非线性随机投影和递归最小二乘法编码任务知识）

Result: 显著降低平均遗忘率，提高准确率，减少内存使用和运行时间，在长任务序列中保持高知识保留

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了有前景的方向，特别适用于效率和效果都至关重要的实际多媒体应用

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏见缩减技术存在"展平效应"，在改善弊势群体时导致优势群体性能下降，需要找到两者兼顾的解决方案

Method: 提出Bias Mitigation through Continual Learning (BM-CL)框架，将偏见缩减重解为域增量持续学习问题，利用Learning without Forgetting和Elastic Weight Consolidation等技术，让模型在调整公平性条件时保持对优势群体的知识

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上进行实验，证明该框架能够有效缩减偏见，同时最小化原始知识的丢失

Conclusion: 该研究将公平性和持续学习领域相结合，为开发既公平又高效的机器学习系统提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉地点识别(VPR)方法存在计算开销高、跨域迁移能力有限的问题，需要一种无需微调、高效的零样本方案来解决这些限制。

Method: 采用测试时缩放(TTS)框架，利用多模态大语言模型的视觉-语言对齐能力，通过指导基方法进行直接相似性评分。使用结构化提示生成长度可控的JSON输出，消除了两阶段处理。结合不确定性感知自我一致性(UASC)实现实时适应。

Conclusion: 该方法通过测试时缩放框架有效解决了当前VPR方法的计算效率和跨域适应性问题，为零样本视觉地点识别提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别代表性不足，生成公平性降低

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验，使用γ-power散度推导闭式优化目标，并构建等权重潜在混合分布进行类别平衡生成

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE在严重类别不平衡情况下FID分数最低，在各类别F1评估中均优于条件高斯VAE

Conclusion: 该方法在极端不平衡情况下显著提高了生成公平性和多样性，而高斯模型在轻度不平衡时仍具有竞争力

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction,
particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due
to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight

ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving
critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods.
  While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of

parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than
Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments.
ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional
performance and accessibility for real-world applications.

Motivation: 挑战传统神经语音编解码器中复杂的残差向量量化(RVQ)堆栈的需求，寻求更简单、低延迟的量化方法

Method: 直接在mel频谱图上操作，将其视为2D数据，对非重叠的4x4块进行量化到共享码本；采用后期对抗微调VQ-VAE，并从头训练HiFi-GAN声码器

Result: 在16kHz语音约7.5kbps速率下，通过STOI、PESQ、MCD、ViSQOL等客观指标评估，显示与最先进神经编解码器相比具有竞争性的感知质量和可懂度

Conclusion: 简化的非残差架构可作为未来低延迟编解码器设计的有效开放基础，证明了简单量化方法的有效性

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex
residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler,
single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the
mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4
patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the
architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid.
To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial
fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the
codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for
16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural
codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results
demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive
perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open
foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了全双工对话中的对齐问题，无需精确时间戳，保持了模型的语言能力，实现了高质量的双向交互体验。

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously
with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches,
native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in
a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to
time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,
a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that
operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level
alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained
models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which
introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,
we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural"
monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal
alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or
trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training
paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog
model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting
experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Result: 提出了理论构建和初步实现（如无人机调度、关键词过滤），建立了跨二元组知识整合的注册机制，为可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI提供了概念基础和架构路线图。

Conclusion: SuperBrain框架为集体智能的发展提供了新的理论和方法论基础，通过LLM与人类的协同进化实现了从个体认知到群体元智能的跃升，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出模块化多智能体框架，将法律推理分解为知识获取和应用两阶段，显著提升法律AI系统的透明度和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律推理需要精确解释法律条文和一致应用复杂规则，这对AI系统构成重大挑战，需要解决端到端方法缺乏透明度的问题

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段由专门智能体提取法律概念并形式化规则；第二阶段通过查询分析、符号推理和程序化实现三个步骤应用知识

Result: 在法定税务计算任务上，基础模型准确率从18.8%提升至76.4%，显著缩小了推理模型与基础模型之间的性能差距

Conclusion: 模块化架构和形式化知识表示可以使复杂的法律推理通过计算高效模型实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

TL;DR: L-MARS是一个多智能体法律问答系统，通过分解查询、定向搜索和验证机制来减少幻觉和不确定性，在LegalSearchQA基准测试中显著提高了事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单次检索增强生成(RAG)在法律问答中存在幻觉和不确定性问题，需要更精确的法律检索和推理机制来处理高风险法律领域的需求。

Method: 采用多智能体工作流：分解查询为子问题，在异构源(网络搜索、本地RAG、案例法)进行定向搜索，使用法官智能体验证充分性、管辖权和时效性，通过迭代推理-搜索-验证循环合成答案。

Result: 在200个最新法律选择题的LegalSearchQA基准测试中，L-MARS显著提高了事实准确性，减少了不确定性，获得了人类专家和LLM法官更高的偏好评分。

Conclusion: 多智能体推理与智能搜索相结合为高风险领域部署LLM提供了可扩展且可复现的蓝图，能够实现精确的法律检索和审议。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

TL;DR: 提出了Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS)方法，通过基于物理一致性和数值接近度的轨迹选择来训练大型推理模型，提高材料属性预测的准确性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的材料发现需要准确、校准且物理可接受的配方到属性预测器。现有训练管道使用二元正确性或学习偏好信号来选择推理轨迹，但这些方法不能很好地反映物理可接受性。

Method: 引入Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS)训练时轨迹选择方案，优先选择符合基础物理原理且数值接近目标的轨迹，并采用轻量级停止机制控制计算成本。使用大型教师模型合成的轨迹来微调学生模型。

Result: 与各种拒绝采样基线相比，该方法提高了准确性和校准度，降低了物理违规率，并减少了采样成本。

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了可靠、高效的大型推理模型的实用路径。

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统在1型糖尿病中的实际采用率仍然很低，主要不是技术故障，而是由各种行为、心理和社会障碍驱动

Method: 构建包含专家验证虚拟患者的框架，每个患者具有临床基础的异质性特征和现实采用障碍，模拟与配备多种循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮交互

Result: 研究发现虽然更大和更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，尤其是在现实社交压力下

Conclusion: 结果突显了当前LLM在行为改变方面的关键局限性，为推进医疗保健及其他领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

TL;DR: ReaL-TG是一个强化学习框架，通过微调大语言模型在时序图上进行可解释的链接预测，结合结果奖励机制和LLM评估系统，在性能和解释质量上都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序图神经网络缺乏可解释性且无法应用于未见过的图，现有LLM方法多局限于静态图或小规模合成时序图，且缺乏对推理轨迹质量的评估。

Method: 提出ReaL-TG强化学习框架，使用基于结果的奖励机制微调LLMs，让模型从图结构中自主探索推理策略并生成直接支持预测的解释。引入结合排序指标和LLM-as-a-Judge系统的评估协议。

Result: ReaL-TG-4B（基于Qwen3-4B微调）在排序指标上优于包括GPT-5 mini在内的更大规模前沿LLMs，生成的解释质量得到LLM评估和人工评估的双重确认。

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架成功实现了在真实世界时序图上的可解释链接预测，通过强化学习微调和创新的评估方法，在性能和解释质量方面都取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Motivation: 比较基于LLM的假设搜索与直接程序生成方法在归纳推理任务中的性能差异，探索如何更好地模拟人类归纳推理能力

Method: 使用LLM进行假设搜索，并与直接程序生成方法在少样本规则归纳任务上进行对比实验

Result: 假设搜索方法达到与人类相当的性能水平，而直接程序生成方法明显落后；错误分析揭示了假设生成的关键瓶颈

Conclusion: LLM假设搜索在建模归纳推理方面具有潜力，但需要解决假设生成效率等挑战来构建更高效的系统

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient

Motivation: 现有游戏基准测试缺乏多样性，很少评估代理完成整个故事情节的能力，特别是冒险游戏中复杂的叙事驱动交互带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了FlashAdventure基准测试、CUA-as-a-Judge自动游戏评估器，以及COAST代理框架，该框架利用长期线索记忆来更好地规划和解决顺序任务。

Result: 实验显示当前GUI代理在完成完整故事弧方面表现困难，而COAST通过弥合观察-行为差距显著提高了里程碑完成率。

Conclusion: 尽管COAST有所改进，但人类与最佳性能代理之间仍存在明显差距，需要继续研究来缩小这一鸿沟。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具增强强化学习方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性有限的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: 提出VerlTool框架，包含四个关键贡献：与VeRL的上游对齐、标准化API的统一工具管理、异步rollout执行实现2倍加速、以及在6个ARLT领域的全面评估。

Result: 在数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程任务上实现了与专门系统相当的性能，同时提供了统一的训练基础设施。

Conclusion: VerlTool通过模块化插件架构显著降低了开发开销，为工具增强的强化学习研究提供了可扩展的基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

TL;DR: 提出Q2K多智能体框架，利用LLM进行SKU映射，通过推理、知识和去重三个智能体协作，结合人工干预，在电商产品匹配任务中实现高准确率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中产品SKU匹配是一个持续挑战，特别是当缺少明确标识符且产品名称在不同平台差异很大时。基于规则的启发式方法和关键词相似性经常因忽略品牌、规格或套装配置的细微差别而错误分类产品。

Method: Q2K多智能体框架包含：1）推理智能体生成针对性消歧问题；2）知识智能体通过聚焦网络搜索解决问题；3）去重智能体重用已验证的推理轨迹以减少冗余并确保一致性。还包含人工干预机制来优化不确定情况。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在困难场景（如套装识别和品牌来源消歧）中实现了更高的准确率和鲁棒性。通过重用检索到的推理而不是重复搜索，Q2K在准确性和效率之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: Q2K为产品集成提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案，通过多智能体协作和推理重用机制，有效解决了电商SKU匹配的挑战。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的表现，证明ORMs在执行准确率上优于现有的Best-of-N和Majority Voting方法，在BIRD和SPIDER基准测试中分别获得+4.33%和+2.10%的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以精确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，现有的测试时策略如Best-of-N和Majority Voting依赖表层启发式方法，无法充分评估语义正确性。

Method: 引入结果奖励模型(ORMs)框架，基于语义正确性为生成输出分配效用分数，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上微调多种开源LLMs（Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等）。

Result: ORMs在执行准确率上显著优于ex-BoN和Maj方法：BIRD基准上+4.33%优于ex-BoN，+2.91%优于Maj；Spider基准上+2.10%优于ex-BoN，+0.93%优于Maj。

Conclusion: ORMs是Text-to-SQL任务中有效的启发式方法，特别在复杂查询和候选数量增加时表现更优，且对已对齐SQL生成的模型微调效果最佳。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模分析在线服务隐私实践提供了可能性，是审计网络和互联网的有前景方向，所有数据集和源代码已开源

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制主要针对恶意攻击者，采用防御性拒绝策略。但现实中风险也来自寻求帮助的心理困扰用户（如自残意图），简单拒绝可能导致用户重复尝试、升级行为或转向不安全平台，造成更严重后果。

Method: 提出Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA)范式，结合游戏理论预测用户反应、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制。在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现，将安全转化为信任建立过程。

Result: Oy1在开源模型中达到最先进的安全水平，同时保持高通用能力。在Constructive Benchmark上显示出接近GPT-5的建设性参与度，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上具有接近GPT-o1水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CSA通过从拒绝优先转向指导优先的安全策略，重新定义了模型与用户的关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且有意义帮助的系统。发布了Oy1、代码和基准测试以支持负责任、以用户为中心的AI。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high

*Ruijia Li,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Jiatong Wang,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究系统分析了AI模拟与真人课堂对话的结构和行为差异，发现人类对话在语调长度、提问和反馈方面显著优于AI，且具有更多样的认知引导模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成教育性丰富的对话互动方面面临挑战，需要系统研究AI模拟与真实人类教学对话的差异。

Method: 采用起始-响应-反馈(IRF)编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)进行定量比较，分析对话结构和行为模式。

Result: 人类对话在语调长度、提问(I-Q)和一般反馈(F-F)行为方面显著优于AI。ENA显示人类对话更具认知引导性和多样性，以"问题-事实回应-反馈"教学循环为中心；AI对话则呈现结构简化和行为收敛的"解释-简单回应"循环。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI生成教学对话的关键局限性，为设计和评估更有教育效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

### [401] [EigenBench: A Comparative Behavioral Measure of Value Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01938)
*Jonathn Chang,Leonard Piff,Suvadip Sana,Jasmine X. Li,Lionel Levine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EigenBench是一个无需真实标签的黑盒方法，通过模型间相互评估来量化语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题，为价值对齐提供可比较的基准测试方法。

Method: 给定模型集合、价值体系宪法和场景数据集，让模型相互评估其他模型的输出，使用EigenTrust算法聚合这些评估，生成反映整体加权平均判断的分数向量。

Result: 通过提示角色测试发现，大部分方差由提示解释，但小部分残差量化了模型本身的倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的定量评估框架，能够区分模型本身倾向和提示的影响。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Motivation: 解决GUI自主代理开发中的数据可扩展性、多轮强化学习、纯GUI操作限制和环境稳定性等开放性问题。

Method: 采用系统化训练方法：数据飞轮实现可扩展数据生成、稳定的多轮RL框架、集成文件系统和终端的混合GUI环境、统一沙箱平台进行大规模推演。

Result: 在GUI基准测试中达到88.2(Online-Mind2Web)、47.5(OSWorld)、50.6(WindowsAgentArena)、73.3(AndroidWorld)；在15个游戏套件中平均标准化得分59.8（约60%人类水平）；在信息搜索和软件工程任务中展现良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2显著推进了GUI代理技术状态，在真实世界交互场景中表现出强大的泛化潜力，大规模代理RL训练动态分析为稳定性和效率提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

TL;DR: 以大语言模型为基础的自主决策加强学习（Agentic RL）的出现，将LLM从被动序列生成器转变为处理复杂动态世界的自主决策代理。该综述形式化了这一转变，提出了以核心代理能力和应用领域组织的双重分类法，并将加强学习视为关键机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型加强学习（LLM-RL）采用退化的单步Markov决策过程，而Agentic RL需要处理时间扩展、部分可观测的复杂环境。这一范式转移需要形式化的理论基础和结构化的分析框架来指导未来研究。

Method: 通过对比LLM-RL的单步MDP和Agentic RL的部分可观测MDP（POMDP），提出了两重分类法：一种以计划、工具使用、记忆、推理、自我改进、感知等核心代理能力组织；另一种以应用领域组织。综合分析了超过500份最新研究成果。

Result: 该综述建立了一个完整的理论框架和实践指南，包括开源环境、测试标准和框架的整合。识别了加强学习在将静态模块转化为适应性强、稳健的代理行为中的关键作用。

Conclusion: Agentic RL标志着人工智能领域的重要范式转移，为可扩展、通用的AI代理发展提供了机遇和挑战。这个突出发展的领域需要结构化的研究框架和实践资源来支持未来的创新。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Robix是一个统一的视觉语言架构，集成了机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互，通过三阶段训练策略实现复杂指令执行和自然人类交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人系统中高层认知推理、任务规划和自然语言交互的分离问题，需要一个统一的端到端框架来整合这些能力，使机器人能够执行复杂指令、规划长期任务并与人类自然交互。

Method: 采用三阶段训练策略：1）持续预训练增强基础具身推理能力；2）监督微调将人机交互和任务规划建模为统一的推理-动作序列；3）强化学习提高推理-动作一致性和长期任务连贯性。核心使用思维链推理。

Result: 在交互式任务执行中优于开源和商业基线（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），在多样化指令类型（开放式、多阶段、约束、无效和中断）和各种用户参与任务（如餐桌清理、购物、饮食过滤）上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix作为一个统一的高层认知层，成功整合了推理、规划和交互能力，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Method: 结合力导向投影和流式聚类方法，构建嵌入向量的时空映射，开发了Chronotome交互式工具

Result: 在文本和图像数据用例中展示了该方法的实用性，为理解时间数据集的美学和语义提供了新视角

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效可视化时间演化数据的语义变化，为时间序列数据分析提供了创新的交互探索工具

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's
social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are
difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address
this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based
projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of
embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for
interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image
data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and
semantics of temporal datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共情AI系统无法识别语言表达与真实情绪状态的不一致，因为现有数据集只关注表层情绪识别，缺乏对语言-视觉不一致模式的建模。

Method: 创建基于人本主义疗法的多模态数据集，包含多维标注的语言-视觉不一致性检测，以及参与度评分等行为标注。

Result: 使用E-THER训练的视觉语言模型在共情和治疗对话质量方面显著提升，在维持治疗参与度、减少人工化语言模式等方面优于通用模型。

Conclusion: E-THER数据集为训练真正具有共情能力的AI系统提供了有效框架，基于不一致性训练的模型在治疗性对话中表现更自然和有效。

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to
recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional
states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these
systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the
complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic
understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered
Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for
verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that
develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations
included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying
verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions -
forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional
engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications.
Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed
in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and
VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic
principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models
outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining
therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic
patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

Motivation: 在AR/VR体验中，用户的手臂和手部可作为便捷的触控表面，相比空中界面具有速度、精度和人体工学优势，但缺乏实用方法

Method: 仅使用RGB摄像头（如现代XR头显内置摄像头）实现裸手皮肤输入，无需用户特殊装备

Result: 方法准确度高，在不同光照条件、肤色和身体运动（如行走时输入）下表现稳健，还能提供触摸力度、手指识别、接触角度和旋转等丰富输入元数据

Conclusion: 这项技术为HCI文献中已有充分论证但缺乏实用方法的皮肤界面提供了必要的技术基础

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2023-2024年约1万个COVID-19相关YouTube视频，发现发布时间、标题词汇、情感分析和视频时长等因素显著影响观众参与度，揭示了晚期大流行期间独特的参与模式特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究COVID-19相关YouTube视频在晚期大流行期间的观众参与模式，了解时间、语言和结构因素如何影响视频观看量，为内容创作者和公共卫生传播提供参考。

Method: 分析了2023年1月至2024年10月期间约10,000个COVID-19相关YouTube视频，采用时间序列分析、词汇频率分析、情感分析和分类别时长分析等方法。

Result: 发现发布时间存在周内效应（周一至周五峰值变化）；标题含"shorts"的视频观看量最高（峰值216万次）；情感分析显示处理后相关性增强；不同类别视频时长与观看量呈现明显差异。

Conclusion: 晚期大流行期间COVID-19相关视频的参与模式受发布时间安排、标题词汇选择、主题内容和类型特定时长效应等因素共同驱动，具有明显的特征性模式。

Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published
between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical,
linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late
pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the
first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on
Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a
shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of
video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and
YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency
analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in
August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts
attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in
June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak
correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but
stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r =
0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis
of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on
people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged
288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and
59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns
of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed
distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary,
topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

Motivation: 当前LLM重排序器面临基本权衡：基于监督微调的点式方法缺乏评分区分度，而复杂的列表式方法效率低下，不适用于低延迟应用

Method: 提出两阶段训练管道：1）SFT阶段训练模型生成细粒度整数评分；2）RL阶段使用新颖的列表式奖励进一步优化，将全局排序意识注入高效的点式架构

Result: 在BRIGHT、FollowIR、TREC DL和BEIR基准测试中表现出优越的有效性和鲁棒性。ERank-4B在BRIGHT基准上达到nDCG@10为38.7，32B变体达到最先进的40.2

Conclusion: ERank成功解决了重排序模型的效率与效果权衡问题，为推理LLM在低延迟应用中的重排序任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new
markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels
and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to
provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging
e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching
(CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to
address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning
abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query
understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query
augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a
multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in
successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8%
reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.

### [412] [From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02077)
*Refat Othman,Diaeddin Rimawi,Bruno Rossi,Barbara Russo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了14种最先进的句子转换器模型，用于自动化将攻击描述映射到CVE漏洞，multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1模型表现最佳，F1分数达89.0，能够提高安全事件响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工将攻击与CVE漏洞进行映射非常困难且不可行，需要自动化方法来实现及时的事件响应和提供可操作的见解。

Method: 评估14种最先进的句子转换器模型，使用攻击技术描述来自动识别漏洞，对比各模型的分类性能。

Result: multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1模型表现最优，F1分数为89.0，精度为84.0，召回率为94.7。模型识别的56%漏洞在CVE库中有对应攻击记录，61%与CVE库中的漏洞相符合，还发现了275个未在MITRE库中记录的新映射关系。

Conclusion: 自动化链接攻击技术与漏洞能够显著提升软件安全事件的检测和响应能力，缩短漏洞可袭的时间窗口，为构建更安全的系统做出贡献。

Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even
after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly
disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is
essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with
immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is
infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying
vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate
that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior
classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an
F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was
observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet
model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an
attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to
those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results
revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the
MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques
to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities
related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during
which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the
development of more secure systems.

generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar
tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,

Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource
for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban
intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing
datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information
richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a
fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban
signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for
drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection
types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000
TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts
per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw
videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements
validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification
of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of
interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining,
traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and

using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Motivation: 深度学习在机器人感知中广泛应用，但现有方法缺乏对预测不确定性的准确估计，这限制了概率状态估计器的性能。需要一种高效的方法来推断深度神经网络测量的不确定性。

Method: 在现有的DL位姿预测器基础上，添加两个独立的多层感知器分别处理平移和旋转部分的不确定性推断，冻结预训练模型参数，仅训练不确定性模块。

Result: 方法在合成数据和真实数据上都显示出优势，相比固定协方差方法，能够动态推断测量不确定性，提升物体相对状态估计的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法以最小的计算开销实现了有效的aleatoric不确定性推理，适用于边缘设备部署，显著改善了基于深度学习的物体相对状态估计任务。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Motivation: 现有的关节估计方法主要局限于受控环境，假设固定相机视角或直接观测不同物体状态，在真实无约束环境中容易失败。而人类通过观察他人操作物体就能轻松推断关节结构，这启发了本研究的思路。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪技术和因子图优化框架，直接从原始RGB-D视频中鲁棒地估计关节部件轨迹和关节轴。同时创建了首个以自我为中心的在野数据集Arti4D，包含场景级别的关节物体交互数据。

Result: 在Arti4D数据集上对多种经典和学习基线的基准测试表明，ArtiPoint表现出优越的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint为在动态相机运动和部分观测条件下估计关节物体模型提供了有效的解决方案，Arti4D数据集的发布将推动该领域未来研究的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

TL;DR: 通过模拟深度摄像头噪声模型训练神经网络，提出Camera Depth Models(CDMs)方法，在不需真实世界微调的情况下实现了模拟到真实的无缝迁移，为机器人操控任务提供了高精度的深度信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器人操控主要依赖2D视觉观测，但普遍存在精度不足和噪声问题，影响了算法的通用性。而人类在3D世界中更依赗于物理属性如距离、大小和形状，这种3D几何信息可以通过深度摄像头获取。

Method: 提出Camera Depth Models(CDMs)方法，作为深度摄像头的插件，输入RGB图像和原始深度信号，输出去噪后的精确深度值。开发神经数据引擎，通过模拟深度摄像头的噪声模式来生成高质量的配对数据。

Result: CDMs在深度预测上达到了几乎模拟级别的精度，有效缩小了模拟到真实的间隔。在两个具有挑战性的长期期任务中，包含关节、反射性和细长物体，无需真实世界微调的策略能够无缝迁移到真实机器人，性能减退很小或无减退。

Conclusion: 这项研究为利用模拟数据和3D信息在通用机器人策略中的应用开启了新方向，证明了通过模拟深度摄像头噪声模型可以有效解决模拟到真实的迁移问题，为机器人操控领域提供了更可靠的深度感知能力。

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those
associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of
a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different
visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced,
combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count,
fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters
(i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features
are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using
different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used
to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble

Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging
data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are
predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We
present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering
framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA
combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to
produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method
supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes
to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking
platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across
multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases,
improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%,
and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis
and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向全身CT中病灶的准确分割对于监测疾病进展和治疗反应至关重要，现有自动化方法在跨时间一致跟踪单个病灶方面仍存在局限

Method: 扩展LongiSeg框架使其具备可提示能力，通过点和掩码交互实现病灶特异性跟踪；利用大规模合成纵向CT数据集进行预训练以解决训练数据有限的问题

Result: 预训练显著提升了利用纵向上下文的能力，与从头训练的模型相比，Dice系数提高了多达6个百分点

Conclusion: 将纵向上下文与交互式提示相结合，能够实现稳健的病灶跟踪，证明了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了全能模型(Gemini 2.5 Pro)与专业医学图像分割模型的性能。结果显示全能模型在难样本上更稳健，但专业模型在细粒度任务上仍有优势，两者具有互补潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估全能模型在知识密集领域(医学图像分割)能否可以取代专业模型

Method: 对比研究Gemini 2.5 Pro与专业深度学习模型在3个医学图像分割任务(息肉、视网膜血管、乳腺瘤)上的零样本性能，分析最简单和最困难的案例子集

Result: 息肉和乳腺瘤分割任务中，专业模型在简单样本上更好，但全能模型在困难样本上更稳健；视网膜血管分割中，专业模型在所有样本上都更优

Conclusion: 当前全能模型还不能完全替代专业模型，但具有互补潜力，特别是在处理具有挑战性的边缘案例时

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study
analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5
Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的乳腹癌风险预测模型性能偏低且未整合数字乳腹成像技术(DBT)，需要更准确的早期风险识别方法

Method: 使用Meta AI DINOv2图像编码器提取特征，结合累积风险层，基于161,753份DBT检查数据训练深度学习风险预测器

Result: 在测试集上实现了AUROC 0.80的五年乳腹癌风险预测性能

Conclusion: DBT基于深度学习方法在乳腹癌风险预测方面具有强大潜力，可作为传统风险评估工具的补充

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Method: 回顾性多中心研究，收集1747名女性乳腺病变患者的超声数据。通过逻辑回归构建BIRADS、形态学和融合指数图模型，并与3名开发者和2个ChatGPT模型进行性能比较

Result: 融合模型在检查建议准确度达83.0%，恶性预测准确度达83.8%，AUC分别为0.901和0.853，显著超过独立模型、开发者和ChatGPT模型

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然比NeRF更快，但仍无法满足实时应用的帧率要求，需要在减少排序冗余和保持光栅化效率之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出瓦片分组方法：在排序阶段将小瓦片组合成大瓦片共享排序操作，在光栅化阶段使用位掩码标识相关小瓦片，实现排序用大瓦片、光栅化用小瓦片的优化策略。

Result: 实验结果显示GS-TG相比最先进的3D-GS加速器平均加速1.54倍，且无需重新训练或微调，可与现有优化技术无缝集成。

Conclusion: GS-TG通过巧妙的瓦片分组和位掩码机制，成功解决了3D-GS渲染中的关键权衡问题，实现了显著的速度提升，是一种无损且实用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to
neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image
quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still
struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based
accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting
operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical
trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively
reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary
rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG
groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across
tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During
rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small
tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG
enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping
tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with
the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is
a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be
seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental
results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over
state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

Conclusion: LatentEdit提供了一个轻量级即插即用解决方案，显著提升了实时部署效率，在扩散式图像编辑领域取得了重要进展。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Conclusion: IntrinsicReal通过创新的双伪标签策略有效弥合了合成与真实数据之间的领域差距，为真实世界内在图像分解提供了有效的领域自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions
in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at
https://github.com/isl-org/unifi3d.
