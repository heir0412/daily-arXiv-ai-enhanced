TL;DR: 本文比较了大型语言模型在痴呆症检测中的不同适应策略，包括上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态集成，发现类质心演示选择、推理增强和token级微调效果最佳，且适当调整的开源模型可媲美商业系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国超过一半的阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症患者未被诊断，基于语音的筛查提供了一种可扩展的检测方法，需要探索有效的语言模型适应策略来提高检测准确性。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型，采用上下文学习（不同演示选择策略）、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态集成等适应策略。

Result: 类质心演示在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理增强改善了较小模型的性能，token级微调通常产生最好的分数。添加分类头显著改善了表现不佳的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超越顶级纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适应策略（包括演示选择、推理设计和调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测至关重要，适当调整的开源模型可以匹配或超越商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出强化行为对齐(RBA)框架，通过自合成方法和强化学习提升语音大语言模型在指令跟随任务中的性能，超越传统蒸馏方法并在多个任务上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本LLMs存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时表现不佳。

Method: 采用自合成方法由强大的教师LLM生成高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免依赖人工标注的监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，超越传统蒸馏基线，并在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上仅使用自生成数据即达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著缩小语音与文本LLMs之间的性能差距，为多模态语言模型的对齐提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调Mistral 7B LLM模型结合RAG进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析，生成图表和文本摘要，并通过层次堆叠整合为综合报告


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供互补的图表和文本视角，进行信息丰富的定性和定量分析

Method: 采用4-bit量化的PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)，第一层生成图表和文本摘要及情感分数，高层进行层次堆叠整合

Result: 该方法能够有效消除LLM幻觉问题，为加密货币新闻分析提供重要的定性和定量洞察

Conclusion: 微调Mistral 7B LLM模型结合知识图谱表示和多层次分析方法，是进行加密货币新闻分析的有效解决方案

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个基于LLM处理的意大利立法过程事件日志数据集（1987-2022年），旨在为法律流程挖掘提供基准数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域受限于数据可获取性和质量，需要高质量的法律流程数据集来推动该领域发展

Method: 从Normattiva门户网站获取非结构化数据，使用大语言模型(LLMs)进行结构化处理，构建意大利立法过程的综合事件日志

Result: 成功创建了ProLiFIC数据集，包含1987-2022年意大利立法过程的完整事件日志，并展示了初步分析示例

Conclusion: ProLiFIC数据集可作为法律流程挖掘的基准，促进该领域的新发展，展示了LLM与流程挖掘结合的有效性

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过层次话语树编码营收会议调用，结合文本、音频、视频情感信号和结构元数据，生成语义丰富的嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法抓取营收会议调用中层次化的话语结构和丰富的多模态信息。

Method: 提出两阶段变换器架构：第一阶段使用对比学习在节点级别编码多模态内容和话语元数据，第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。每个节点包含独白或问答对，并强化了情感信号和结构元数据。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义丰富的表征，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在财务报告领域有应用价值，还能扩展到医疗电话、教育和政治话语等高风险领域，为多模态话语表征提供了健壮可解释的方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 早期识别青少年自杀意念的人工智能模型，通过分析论坛帖子预测自杀意念行为，准确率达73%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难，许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，逐序处理用户发布和互动的论坛帖子，预测其是否会发布自杀意念内容，无需显式自我曝露作为输入

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛数据集上，模型预测未来自杀意念行为的平衡准确率达到0.73

Conclusion: 这种方法可以作为传统方法的有力补充，为早期识别和干预青少年自杀风险提供新的技术手段

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种使用线性探针的可扩展、实时的实体级幻觉检测方法，通过网络搜索标注的数据集训练，在长文本生成中超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险应用中的幻觉问题可能造成严重害备，而现有检测方法要么限于短词条查询要么需要程度外部验证

Method: 通过网络搜索标注模型响应中的实体级幻觉（如虚构名称、日期、引用），使用线性探针训练效果良好的幻觉分类器

Result: 在四个模型家族中一致超越基线方法，在Llama-3.3-70B上AUC达到0.90（vs 0.71），并且能够测数学推理任务中的错误答案

Conclusion: 这种以实体级标签为基础的方法为可扩展的实时幻觉检测提供了有前景的新途径

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈理论改进语义分歧检测，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于空间聚类优化，而非信息理论分析，存在优化目标不一致的问题

Method: 将确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)转化为实用算法，用计算高效的上界替代难处理的KL散度项，开发UDIB方法

Result: UDIB生成共享主题表示，不仅空间一致，而且从根本上结构化以最大化提示-响应关系的信息量

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供更优基础，为检测LLM幻觉提供了新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AR²框架，通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，将核心问题转换为叙事丰富的描述，训练学生模型提取底层计算逻辑，显著提升未见编程任务的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，忽视了抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键技能

Method: AR²框架：教师模型将核心问题转换为叙事丰富但逻辑不变的挑战性描述，学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙事问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来提升LLM的事实性回答能力，结合内部知识提取和外部知识检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致答案时的限制，传统RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理，限制了组合推理和事实不一致性检测能力

Method: 通过提问提取种子知识图，然后迭代扩展使用LLM的隐含知识，最后通过外部检索选择性精炼图象，提高事实覆盖率和纠正错误

Result: 在三个多样化事实QA测试集上表现一致提升，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线提示和静态KG增强方法

Conclusion: 推理时KG构建是一个有前景的方向，能够以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式提升LLM的事实性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse框架有效解决了多文档科学推理的挑战，提供了结构化的研究发展可视化，并发布了相应的基准数据集。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR是一个专门为边缘设备优化的OCR系统，在资源受限环境下表现出色，相比大型视觉语言模型在效率和成本方面具有显著优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声和多样化真实场景图像中的OCR挑战，特别是在边缘部署环境下对资源受限设备的需求

Method: 构建Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，并对5种最先进的大型视觉语言模型和2种传统OCR系统进行大规模比较评估，使用包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度快35倍(平均每图0.17秒)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图0.006美元)

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是最优选择，即使在LLM时代也是如此

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大型语言模型作为评估器存在自我偏好偏差，提出使用轻量级导向向量在推理时缓解此问题，能减少97%的不合理自我偏好，但存在稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自我偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身输出而非其他模型输出，这影响了评估的公平性和可靠性，特别是在偏好调优和模型路由等任务中。

Method: 构建区分合理和不合理自我偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预而不需要重新训练。

Result: 导向向量能将不合理自我偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法，但在合理自我偏好和无偏一致性方面表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 导向向量作为LLM-as-judges的安全防护措施既有前景也有局限，自我偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更稳健的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义向量相似性，研究发现这两者弱相关，但语义向量能抓取临床意义关联，可用于补充临床注释和症状分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记内容丰富但非结构化，需要探索SNOMED CT标准化术语的共现模式和语义相似性关系，以支持大规模分析和互操性。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，采用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量模型(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义相似性。

Result: 共现和语义相似性呈弱相关，但向量形式能抓取临床意义关联，并能预测后期记录的概念。聚类分析形成了相关临床主题，且共现模式与病人结局(死亡率、再入院率)相关。

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义向量在改善文档完整性、发现潜在临床关联和支持决策应用方面具有互补价值。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域立场检测中的领域适应问题，传统方法在新目标域中表现不佳，需要能够从新领域获取有用示例的方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间，实现跨目标和跨领域的知识迁移

Result: 在两个数据集上的多个跨目标和跨领域场景中评估，相比六个广泛使用的立场检测模型，MLSD显示出统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，为少样本学习在立场检测任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SiLVERScore新指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成，避免传统回译评估的两步流程问题，在多个数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语生成评估采用回译方法（生成手语→识别回文本→文本指标比较），存在两个主要问题：1）无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（面部表情、空间语法、韵律）；2）难以区分错误来自生成模型还是翻译系统

Method: 提出SiLVERScore指标，基于语义感知的嵌入空间评估方法，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成质量，避免了两步评估流程

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore达到近乎完美的判别性能（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率<7%），显著优于传统评估指标

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一个更直接、更准确的手语生成评估方法，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态语义信息，解决了传统回译评估的模糊性问题

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估套件，用于系统评估大型视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型在多个指标上都偏离人类模式，而任务成功率和图像-语言对齐度并不能准确预测基础效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VLM评测标准主要测试单轮或问答背景下的理解能力，而真实世界中的基础过程是一个交互性的逐步沟通过程，需要更系统的评估方法。

Method: 研究者开发了一个四指标的评估套件（基础效率、内容对齐度、词汇适应性和人类相似度），并在150个自我对战会话中对三款商业VLM进行测试，与人类对比组进行对比分析。

Result: 三款VLM模型在至少3个指标上都与人类模式存在明显差异，GPT4o-mini表现最接近人类。研究还发现：（1）任务成功率不能估计基础效果；（2）高图像-语言对齐度不能预测任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究提供的评估套件和发现为未来VLM基础能力研究提供了重要的理论框架和实践指南，强调了交互性基础评估的必要性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估解决LLM输出与句子级评估不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了现有的基于句子对齐的评估方法。

Method: 1) Align阶段：自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系，重建目标以匹配源句子数量；2) n-Chunk滑动评估阶段：计算1-4个chunk的平均指标分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上与人工判断高度一致；产生的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架是文档级机器翻译系统准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NE-PADD是一种利用命名实体知识进行部分音频深度伪造检测的新方法，通过语音命名实体识别和注意力聚合机制，在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子级音频深度伪造检测无法定位伪造位置，而部分音频深度伪造检测中利用音频语义信息（特别是命名实体）的研究仍不足。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD，采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失引导PADD利用命名实体语义。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 证明了在部分音频深度伪造检测中整合命名实体知识的有效性。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，即表面语法连贯但语用矛盾、情感丰富或修辞颠覆的表述。研究发现当前大语言模型在处理这类具有深层语义的文本时存在明显局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在理解具有深层隐含意义的语言现象时的能力边界，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建了包含1200多个精心策划的多语言Drivelology示例数据集，通过专家评审和多轮讨论进行标注。评估了多种LLM在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示LLMs存在明显局限性：模型经常将Drivelology与浅层废话混淆，产生不连贯的论证，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLMs在语用理解方面的深层次表征差距，表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解。发布数据集和代码以促进超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在语言理解、复杂问题解决和代码生成等任务的表现，但对其如何影响语言模型可信度的全面理解仍然不足，需要系统性的调查分析

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序系统梳理推理模型和CoT技术的最新研究，从五个可信度维度（真实性、安全性、鲁棒性、公平性、隐私性）分析各研究的方法论、发现和局限性

Result: 研究发现推理技术在缓解幻觉、检测有害内容和提高鲁棒性方面有潜力增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在相当甚至更大的脆弱性

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的及时且有价值的资源，指出了未来研究方向，强调需要在提升推理能力的同时关注模型的可信度问题

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了基于探针方法检测LLM有害指令的范式，发现探针学习的是表面模式而非语义有害性，揭示了当前方法的安全假象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全隐患，现有研究使用探针方法检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现差，怀疑探针学习的是表面模式而非语义有害性。

Method: 通过控制实验系统验证假设：首先展示简单n-gram方法的可比性能，然后使用语义清洗数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性。

Result: 确认探针确实学习指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义有害性，揭示了当前基于探针方法的安全检测存在虚假安全感。

Conclusion: 需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的安全研究方向提供建议，项目已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了现有移动代理的局限性，在复杂长序列移动任务中表现出色，为移动自动化提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂抽象问答任务中的推理能力不足问题，充分利用检索扩展生成技术中的大量信息来提升推理准确性

Method: 提出矩阵思维（MoT）结构，通过创新的"列-单元免通"机制在水平和垂直两个维度进行多策略深层次思考，并构建知识图三元组和原始文本组合的知识单元来实现事实纠正

Conclusion: MoT框架通过创新的矩阵思维结构和知识纠正机制，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了复杂问答任务的准确性，为提升LLM推理能力提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得了显著进步，但诗歌特别是韩国诗歌因其比喻性语言和文化特定性而被忽视，需要专门的数据集来支持计算分析

Method: 构建包含7,662条目的多标签情感数据集，其中7,007条行级注释和655条作品级注释，使用44个细粒度情感类别，并通过序列细调方法训练韩语模型

Result: 细调后的韩语模型显著超过之前模型，F1-micro指标从0.34提升到0.60，能够更好识别时间和文化特定的情感表达，同时保持现代韩国诗歌的核心情感

Conclusion: 该研究基于KPoEM数据集基于结构化数据展现了通过计算方法进行诗歌情感定量探索的新可能性，同时完整保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细节

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

### [29] [SPFT-SQL: Enhancing Large Language Model for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Self-Play Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03937)
*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用基于验证的迭代微调，根据数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，使主模型能区分正确和错误的SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个广泛使用的基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL通过针对性的改进有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，显著提升了模型生成准确SQL查询的能力。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型为每个角色系统地构建多维度角色档案，从而构建VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 构建了包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音、1228个独特角色的综合性基准，并利用该基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维度评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限。

Conclusion: VoxRole基准填补了语音角色扮演领域的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个标准化工具，有助于推动该领域的发展和研究。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CANDY是一个评估大语言模型中文事实核查能力的基准，包含约2万个标注实例。研究发现当前LLMs在事实核查方面存在局限，即使使用思维链和少样本提示，仍常产生事实捏造等错误。虽然LLMs单独使用不可靠，但作为辅助工具可显著提升人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在事实核查方面的有效性仍不确定，需要系统评估其在中国虚假信息核查中的能力和局限性。

Method: 构建CANDY基准数据集（约20k标注实例），使用思维链推理和少样本提示增强LLMs，开发分类法分析错误解释类型。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，事实捏造是最常见的失败模式。LLMs作为辅助工具可提升人类表现45%。

Conclusion: LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠，但作为人类辅助工具具有巨大潜力。数据集和代码已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Method: 利用少量Ladin-意大利语并行句对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据构建合成数据集，并采用严格筛选咄反向翻译程序确保语言质量

Result: 创建了Ladin语首个公开情感分析咄多选题答案数据集，并证明合成数据能夠显著提升意大利语-Ladin语翻译的性能

Conclusion: 为Ladin这种不充分代表的危机语言提供了基础性NLP资源，为更广泛的NLP研究咄下游应用奠定了基础

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA是一个无需训练的TKGQA框架，通过递归分解问题、自底向上求解和多路径答案聚合来提升时态知识图谱问答性能，在复杂查询处理上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时间约束，缺乏处理复杂时间查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题。

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时态问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器，通过递归思维将问题分解为子问题，利用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并采用多路径答案聚合提高容错性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架有效解决了复杂时间查询处理问题，通过递归分解和多路径聚合显著提升了TKGQA的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实世界应用中面对语言变异性时的鲁棒性，检验基准测试评估是否能可靠衡量模型能力。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，测量34个最先进LLM在不同改写输入下的效果变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入下的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 基准测试评估的可靠性受到挑战，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the

practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将功能语法与注意力模型相结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的集成方法有效解决了隐蔽叙事检测和解释生成的挑战，通过知识增强提高了NLP系统在敏感文本分析中的性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 词汇对齐能提升交流效果，但在大语言模型新进展背景下，会话机器人的词汇对齐技术仍然研究不涵。需要先构建稳定的个性化词汇模型作为基础。

Method: 通过变化语音转写数据量和不同词性类别的关键词数量，构建个性化词汇模型。使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标评估模型在时间上的稳定性。

Result: 小型紧凑模型表现最佳：10分钟语音转写数据，具体配置为形容词5个、连词5个，副词、名词、代词、动词各10个。这种配置在性能和数据效率上取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实用方法，考虑了最小数据需求，为会话机器人的词汇对齐技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

the questions are of good quality. We evaluate 6 different language models,
both decoder and encoder models of varying sizes, showing that the benchmark is
sufficiently difficult and that there is a large performance discrepancy
amongst the languages. The dataset and survey evaluations are freely available.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了联合建模实体和话语关系的方法，实验表明整合这两种特征能显著提升连贯性评估模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多单独关注实体特征或话语关系特征，很少将两者结合，需要探索同时建模这两种特征的方法

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法来进行连贯性评估

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，整合两种特征显著提升了连贯性模型的性能

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，整合两种特征能带来显著性能提升

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个多智能体框架，用于生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据，通过分解咨询任务到专门化的LLM智能体来提升生成质量，在多个评估维度上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门化的LLM智能体处理，每个智能体模拟关键心理技术。同时提出统一的评估框架整合多种自动和专家指标。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%、CBT特定技能4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT数据微调的模型性能更好，平均提升6.3%一般咨询技能和7.3% CBT特定技能。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能有效生成高质量的心理咨询数据，解决了数据稀缺问题，并通过多智能体方法更好地捕捉真实咨询的复杂性，为心理咨询LLM的微调提供了优质数据源。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的即插即用双增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来解决标注数据稀缺问题，在两个Twitter数据集上F1分数分别提升17.67%和15.57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且费时，需要解决数据稀缺问题以提高模型性能。

Method: 提出双增强框架：显式增强使用大语言模型通过5种生成策略增强文本信息；隐式增强设计5种新颖的扰动技术在特征空间对结构融合嵌入进行操作，保持语义和关系属性同时增加多样性。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架通过双增强策略有效解决了社交媒体事件检测中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准来评估大语言模型的反直觉能力，测试模型能否克服训练偏见并遵循对抗性指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后存在认知惯性，难以遵循与标准化模式冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性。

Method: 构建包含8类挑战的1012个中英文问题数据集，使用人类参与流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge框架进行评估。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs存在认知惯性问题，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，该基准可作为诊断工具和发展方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别大语言模型依赖静态训练数据导致的风险，当医疗建议随新研究发展而更新时，模型可能提供有害的过时建议或在临床推理任务中失败。

Method: 构建了两个新的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖普通生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，涵盖医学共识随时间变化的情况），并对八个主流大语言模型进行了评估。

Result: 所有模型都一致地依赖过时知识，研究分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这种现象的影响。

Conclusion: 为开发更新现和可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了减缓这一问题的未来研究方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: PARCO是一个通过音素增强和对比实体消歧的上下文ASR方法，显著提升了特定领域命名实体识别性能，在中英文数据集上均优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）识别上表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限和独立token处理方式，无法有效捕捉细粒度音素变化和完整的多token偏置

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索并减少误报

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项下），显著优于基线方法，在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健增益

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习机制有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性和泛化能力

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，即使微小的提示词变化也能显著改变偏见测量结果，有时甚至完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择指标相比概率指标会放大偏见，这对NLP基准测试的生态效度提出了新挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。现有评估方法通常使用与自然语言分布不同的构造任务提示，这些提示会明示或暗示性别偏见相关内容的存在，研究者希望了解这种评估目的的显性化如何影响LLM性别偏见的测量结果。

Method: 研究测试了在不同提示条件下的模型表现：(1)使测试情境显著化，(2)使性别相关内容显著化。在四种任务格式中使用token概率和离散选择两种指标来评估提示敏感性。

Result: 研究发现即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时会完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择指标倾向于比概率指标放大偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试社区提出了新难题：良好控制的测试设计能在多大程度上触发LLM的"测试模式"表现，这对未来基准测试的生态效度意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了开源语言模型在日本历法处理能力上的表现，发现即使日语中心模型也在历法运算和多历法一致性方面遇到困难，强调了发展具有文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型时间理解能力的研究主要集中在公历，而许多非公历系统（如日本历、希吉来历、希伯来历）仍在活跃使用且反映文化根基的时间概念。需要评估语言模型处理这类非公历的能力。

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，系统性地评估一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型在日本历法处理上的表现。

Result: 某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心模型也在日本历法的数学运算和保持不同历法之间的一致性方面遇到困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了发展具有更好文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性，以满足不同文化背景下的时间理解需求。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测显著提升计算效率和表示质量，为自监督骨架动作识别提供了新方向

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调，有效解决视觉模型中的多重偏差问题，无需测试时组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多重重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 提出广义多重偏差缓解(GMBM)框架：1) 自适应偏差集成学习(ABIL)训练每个属性的编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器识别偏差；2) 梯度抑制微调从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有偏差的紧凑网络。

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证，提升了最差组准确率，将多重属性偏差放大减半，并在偏差复杂性和分布变化加剧时实现了SBA新低。

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多重偏差解决方案，无需测试时组标签，能有效处理视觉识别中的多重偏差问题。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过消融研究优化了nnU-Net在心辅图左室分割中的组件，发展出了一种轻量级U-Net模型，在保持类似性能的同时大大缩小了模型规模和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心辅图左室分割中表现良好，但模型过大过慢，限制了实时应用。需要找到最有效的组件来构建更轻量化的模型。

Method: 通过消融研究逐步评估数据增帿方案、网络架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术。识别simple affine augmentations和deep supervision是关键因素。

Result: 发展出的轻量级U-Net（2M参数）在CAMUS数据集上达到了与nnU-Net（33M参数）统计学上相等的性能（Dice分数0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），模型大小减少16倍，速度提高4倍。跨数据集评估也证明了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帿和深度监督是关键，复杂增帿和大模型容量带来的收益逐渐减少。轻量级U-Net在保持性能的同时实现了更小的模型规模和更快的速度，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

TL;DR: Reg3D是一个创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过将几何感知监督直接整合到训练过程中，解决了现有方法仅依赖文本监督无法提供3D空间表示学习所需几何约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得了显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: Reg3D采用双重监督范式，在双编码器架构中设计互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，同时利用3D几何信息作为输入和显式学习目标，通过几何一致性强制执行来促进空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Conclusion: QuantV2X证明了完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中的可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of

Motivation: 现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢。需要一种更高效的方法来比较表示建筑布局的图结构

Method: 使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点嵌入的距离函数，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图比较方法，适用于搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解调整CLIP内部参数空间，仅需微调0.04%的参数就能实现领域适应，在自然和生物医学数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和全模型微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识。需要一种更高效、稳定的适应方法。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，实现领域适应，不注入额外模块，仅微调0.04%的参数。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越的视觉语言模型适应方法，能更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时支持可解释性分析。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种专门用于植物病害识别的边缘设备深度学习模型STA-Net，通过形状-纹理分离注意力机制提升了对病变特征的捐描能力，在轻量化模型中达到了89%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业中植物病害识别需要在边缘设备上部署高精度模型，但现有轻量化网络的注意力机制主要为通用物体识别设计，无法有效捐揍植物病变的细微特征如不规则病变形状和复杂纹理。

Method: 两部分方案：1）使用无需训练的神经网络架构搜索方法DeepMAD构建高效边缘网络背骨；2）提出形状-纹理注意力模块STAM，将注意力分解为两个分支：使用可变形卷积DCNv4的形状感知分支和使用Gabor滤波器的纹理感知分支。

Result: 在CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型（401K参数，51.1M FLOPs）达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。消融实验证明STAM在基线模型和标准注意力模型上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过解合领域知识的分离式注意力机制，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但由于光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性等因素，该任务尚未得到充分探索且识别精度严重受限。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-非对称增强(GAE)模块和定位引导分支(LGB)，增强多尺度特征表示并生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，通过多尺度监督解码器(MSSD)进行精确预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验证实SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并展现出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化性。

Conclusion: SLENet框架有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，为海洋生态学研究提供了有力的技术支撑，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

Motivation: 传统图像滿散模型基于独立采样的静态图像进行训练，这种方式在捐损了时间序列信息的同时导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和泛化能力下降

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改善滿散训练，无需侯网络结构修改即可集成到标准滿散训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上评估，该方法实现了2倍以上的收敛加速，在训练和验证分布上都获得了更低的FID指标，同时提升了生成的多样性

Conclusion: 通过视频序列的时间归纳偏置可以有效改善滿散模型训练效果，优化分析显示该正则化方法能够降低梯度方差，从而促进更快的收敛

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐来解决放射诊断中的误读、注意力盲点和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（包括误读错误、注意力盲点和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足局部检测、全局推理和语义一致报告的需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强的视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。使用语言模型重写和处理放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答任务上达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射诊断中的关键挑战，为临床实践提供了强大的分析工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL成功提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的表现，为提示学习提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理低信息区域时计算冗余，固定阈值token选择方法无法适应不同复杂度的样本，导致性能不佳

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略识别并自适应丢弃低信息区域，设计跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块有效整合互补特征

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合机制，成功解决了多模态检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了更好的精度-效率权衡

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 提出的CZSFR任务和SalientFusion方法有效解决了食物识别中的零样本学习问题，特别是在处理背景干扰、角色混淆和语义偏差方面表现出色

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models
examined in this survey is available in Our Repository

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS是一个生成式占用世界模型，通过时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务重新定义占用预测，解决了传统自回归方法在效率、长期生成质量下降和可控性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归占用世界模型存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种能够同时处理精细3D几何和动态场景演化的高效解决方案。

Method: 提出TENS任务将时间序列建模分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测，使用TensFormer管理时间因果性和空间关系，并采用整体姿态聚合策略实现占用和自运动的统一序列建模。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理速度方面均优于现有最先进方法，实现了高质量的长时期占用生成。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间下一尺度预测框架，有效解决了占用世界模型的关键挑战，为可控、高效的高保真3D场景生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督学习方法，利用视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件，结合密集对比学习来建立密集功能对应关系，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系对形状重建和机器人操作等任务很重要。物体功能（对其他物体的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 基于视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件，然后与密集对比学习结合，将功能和空间知识蒸馏到新模型中，以建立密集功能对应关系。

Result: 在合成和真实评估数据集上的结果表明，该方法优于基于现成自监督图像表示和接地视觉语言模型的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉语言模型和密集对比学习的结合，成功实现了跨类别物体的密集功能对应关系建立，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attn-Adapter是一种在线少样本学习框架，通过双重注意力机制增强CLIP的适应性，无需重新训练基础模型即可实现动态适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型在零样本识别中表现出色，但在少样本场景下面临计算密集型离线微调和过拟合的风险

Method: 采用双重注意力机制：Memory Attn-Adapter利用支持样本优化类别嵌入，Local-Global Attn-Adapter通过整合局部和全局特征丰富图像嵌入

Result: 在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理并在不同CLIP骨干网络上具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter提供了一个有效的在线少样本学习解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性，实现了动态适应和优异性能

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

*Xiaofu Chen,Israfel Salazar,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在明显缺陷：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示相似性的指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，而基于大语言模型的指标虽然相关性好但成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用。

Method: SPECS基于CLIPScore进行改进，通过新的目标函数强调特异性 - 奖励正确的细节描述并惩罚错误的细节，专门针对长图像描述任务进行优化。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，使其成为图像描述模型开发中实用的迭代评估工具。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的评估方案，解决了长图像描述任务中现有评估指标的局限性，特别适合模型开发过程中的迭代评估使用。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Conclusion: 生成式基础模型在构建更准确、数据高效和公平的医疗AI系统中具有变革性作用

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端学习的多视角视频编码框架LMVC，通过利用独立视角的运动和内容信息来增强依赖视角的压缩效率，显著优于传统MV-HEVC标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体视频的关键数据源，但数据量巨大导致存储和传输挑战。现有深度学习视频编码主要关注单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足。

Method: 提出特征级视角间运动向量预测方法，利用解码的独立视角运动特征来条件化依赖视角运动编码；提出无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，从解码的独立视角内容特征预测视角间上下文；配合相应的视角间熵模型学习先验信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的LMVC框架大幅优于传统MV-HEVC标准的参考软件，压缩效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为多视角视频编码建立了强大的基线，确保了随机访问和向后兼容性，同时提升了压缩性能，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑精炼的新框架，通过整体区域建模、拓扑完整性Betti约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖体素重叠度量，无法捕捉拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有潜力，但通常是补丁式应用，无法保证全局保持或推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；首次引入拓扑完整性Betti约束联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持久同调的课程精炼方案从粗到细逐步修正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀错误分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长度检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效修正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Motivation: 气胸症如果未及时检测可能导致生命危险，而胸部X光片中小型气胸症疾病可能很难识别

Method: 构建了一个自动化深度学习流水线，采用U-Net网络结构和EfficientNet-B4编码器，在SIIM-ACR数据集上进行训练，使用数据增帽和二元交叉炼加Dice损失函数

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，模型达到了IoU 0.7008和Dice评分0.8241的高分

Conclusion: 该模型能够准确定位气胸症区域，为放射科医生提供有效的辅助诊断支持

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力来增强OOD检测，在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95 4.2%，实现新的SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假负标签会显著降低近OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLMs描述可能的OOD样本生成表达性负句子，针对近OOD场景生成视觉相似的负标签，设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上FPR95降低4.2%，建立新的SOTA，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs的推理能力有效解决了OOD检测中的负空间构建问题，在近OOD和远OOD场景中都表现出色，具有很好的适应性

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖单一图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 提出多模态RSCD方法MMChange：1)图像特征精炼模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2)使用视觉语言模型生成语义描述；3)文本差异增强模块捕获细粒度语义变化；4)图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Conclusion: MMChange通过多模态融合有效提升了遥感变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性，验证了多模态方法在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Motivation: 为了解决WSI分类中空间信息利用不足和传统Transformer方法计算复杂度高、部署困难的问题，提出了一种更高效的空间感知方法。

Method: 使用位置编码模块编码实例坐标空间关系，SAC块基于MLP实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算，避免了自定义CUDA内核的需求。

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过有效利用空间信息和简化的MLP结构，在WSI分类任务中实现了高性能和易部署的优势。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为精心选择的提示词可能展示最佳性能而非真实能力。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示词类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的多模态模型在3个基准测试集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂提示词能力较弱，提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对不同模型类型制定专门的提示词设计原则，以实现更公平和稳健的模型评估，促进透明和公正的多模态模型评测。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:

greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了SliceSemOcc框架，通过竖直切片和高度维度注意力机制改善3D语义占位预测的性能，尤其在小物体检测上取得显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占位预测方法忽视了高度轴信息，传统的通道注意力机制在所有高度层上赋予均匀权重，限制了不同高度特征的强调能力。

Method: 提出SliceSemOcc框架：1）使用全局和局部竖直切片提取氟素特征 2）全局局部融合模块协调细细节和上下文信息 3）SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率，并为每个高度层赋予动态通道注意力权重。

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上进行广泛实验，方法显著提高了平均IoU，尤其在大部分小物体类别上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 详细的消融研究进一步验证了提出的SliceSemOcc框架的有效性，通过竖直切片和高度维度注意力机制显著改善了3D语义占位预测的性能。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Motivation: 神经网络视觉模型可能利用数据中意外的模式做出正确预测，这称为假相关联。识别和减少假相关联对建立可信赖、可靠和可推广的机器学习模型至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法来检测视觉Transformer中的假相关联，使用了有监督和自监督训练的模型，在ImageNet数据集上进行大规模实验。

Conclusion: 提供了存在假信号图片的详细列表，建议在未来研究中谨慎使用，并通过侵入性乳腱种物分类的实际案例验证了方法的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的新问题，提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能有效解决该问题，高多数类比例的包有助于学习

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案，具有低延迟高精度特点。

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Method: 使用K近邻加权融合(KWF)方法聚合邻居特征来生成多视角特征，在无监督方式下选择K个相似特征，并研究了特征聚合过程中的权重选择策略

Result: 在Market1501、MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC数据集上显著提升了Rank@1和mAP指标，特别是在MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC上分别获得9.8%和22.0%的Rank@1提升，同时计算效率显著提高

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角特征聚合有效减少了视角偏差，在不需额外调优的情况下实现了显著的性能提升，适用于大规模人员重识别应用

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Result: 在两个基准数据集LLP和UnAV-100上的多个关键指标上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过整合两种研究方向的优势并互补，有效解决了伪标签噪声传播问题，提升了音频-视觉视频解析的性能

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related

three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of

drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with

neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset

Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在多个角色跨帧交互时存在角色一致性差、生成伪影和对话渲染不准确的问题，导致故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用基于有界注意力的每框掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致的自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性，使用区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置，通过CLIPSeg渲染对话气泡并分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion框架有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的角色一致性和对话准确性问题，为连贯的故事叙述提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality

Conclusion: 简单的预训练视觉模型调整方法通过谨慎的超参数调优可以实现与商业检测器竞争的性能，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUDE是一种基于特征解缠的无监督跨域图像检索方法，通过文本到图像生成模型分离对象特征和域特定风格，并采用渐进式跨域对齐策略，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的无监督跨域图像检索方法通常对整个图像进行跨域特征对齐，但由于对象特征经常与域特定风格纠缠，难以有效处理域间差异。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型将对象特征从域特定风格中解缠，然后通过渐进式跨域对齐策略，从域内到跨域逐步对齐解缠后的对象特征。

Result: 在包含13个域的三个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，DUDE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐策略有效解决了无监督跨域图像检索中的域间差异问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Motivation: 现有的语义分割网络主要针对地面视角照片开发，无法有效处理遥感图像特有的极端尺度变化、前景-背景不平衡和大尺寸图像等问题。DMP方法能够为深度神经网络提供关键的形状信息，在遥感图像分类和目标检测中已显示出优越性能。

Conclusion: 混合DMP架构能够有效提升遥感图像语义分割性能，DMP提供的形状信息对改善分割结果具有重要价值。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Result: 在标准测试集和实际场景中，方法能够在输入条件更弱的情况下生成准确详细的关节对象表征。

Conclusion: 该方法为在稀疏视图和无相机监督的情况下学习关节对象表征提供了有效的解决方案，显著降低了输入要求。

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E是一个基于图像编辑模型的密集几何估计框架，通过将Diffusion Transformer编辑模型适配到确定性任务，在零样本深度和法线估计方面取得了显著性能提升，甚至超越了使用100倍训练数据的方法。


<details>

Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，而图像编辑模型相比文本到图像生成模型可能更适合作为微调基础。研究发现编辑模型具有固有的结构先验，能够更稳定地收敛并获得更高性能。

Method: 提出了FE2E框架，将基于Diffusion Transformer的先进编辑模型适配到密集几何预测任务。具体包括：1）将编辑器的流匹配损失重新表述为"一致速度"训练目标；2）使用对数量化解决精度冲突；3）利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计。

Result: 在不扩大训练数据的情况下，FE2E在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计方面取得了显著性能提升。在ETH3D数据集上实现了超过35%的性能增益，并且超越了使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列方法。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架通过有效利用编辑模型的结构先验和DiT架构的优势，在零样本设置下实现了卓越的性能表现。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes

impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图像描述任务整合图像美学显著性的框架，有效提升了美学描述生成能力。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种新的3D风格转换方法，利用预训练2D滿散模型的知识，通过跨视图风格对齐和实例级风格转换，实现了更好的风格保真度和结构清晰性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景风格转换中存在两个主要问题：1、无法有效提取和转换高级风格语义 2、风格化结果缺乏结构清晰性和分离性，导致不同实例难以区分

Method: 提出两阶段流水线：首先利用滿散先验知识生成关键视角的风格化渲染，然后将风格化关键视图转换到3D表示。包含两个创新设计：跨视图风格对齐（在UNet最后一个上采样块中插入跨视图注意力）和实例级风格转换

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在各种场景中都显著超越了最先进方法，包括前向面向和具有挑战性的360度环境

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生结构更清晰、视觉更一致、艺术性更丰富的3D风格化结果，有效解决了现有方法在高级风格语义提取和结构清晰性方面的限制

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtyINR是一种自监督神经网络框架，通过连续神经表示同时重建物体和探针，无需探针预表征，在低信号条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线叠层衍射成像在纳米尺度分辨率方面表现优异，但当前方法在探针未知情况下重建图像存在困难，特别是在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下，传统迭代方法和深度学习方法的性能受限。

Method: 提出Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR)框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需任何探针预表征。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了卓越的重建质量，在具有挑战性的低信号条件下表现出显著的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息驱动的框架，适用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，一致性模型在2D领域加速效果显著但在3D生成任务中研究不足，需要开发高效的少步数3D流蒸馏方法。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25减少到1-2步，实现0.68秒(1步×2)和0.94秒(2步×2)的延迟，A800上分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的一致性模型蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步数3D生成中达到优异性能，为高效3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Motivation: 为了解决肖像动画中面部属性迁移的挑战，特别是在零样本设置下实现高保真度和空间一致性的跨帧属性迁移。

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络和训练策略，成功实现了零样本肖像动画的高质量面部属性迁移，具有优秀的泛化能力和多属性组合能力。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: 通过结合深度学习和几何约束，开发了一种能够准确检测X光影像中准直器边界的方法，有效减少疾人放射浮量

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

TL;DR: 提出了UCF-UM框架，通过循环评估协议量化统一视觉语言模型在图像理解和生成之间的语义漂移，发现不同模型在跨模态一致性方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法单独测试图像生成和理解能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态转换中的语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Method: 引入UCF-UM循环评估协议，通过交替进行图像到文本和文本到图像的多代转换，提出三个指标：平均累积漂移(MCD)、语义漂移率(SDR)和多代GenEval(MGG)。

Result: 评估了7个最新模型，发现模型间跨模态稳定性差异显著，如BAGEL能保持语义一致性，而Vila-u尽管单次评估表现好但语义漂移快。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，UCF-UM提供了实用的指标来评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Conclusion: 联合训练不同失真类型有助于知识共享，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效的统一解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Method: 采用控制实验方法，使用常见健康问题，变化检索文档类型(有用、有害、对抗性)和问题框架方式(一致、中性、不一致)，分析模型输出与真实答案的一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更安全的RAG系统提供了可操作的见解，强调了在高风险领域实施检索安全保障的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统的全局到本地检索范式存在计算成本高、缺少部分匹配能力等问题，而新兴的高效本地特征搜索技术为改变这种范式提供了可能。

Method: 提出了一种重排序方法，基于本地特征检索相似性动态生成全局特征，利用多维尺度缩放技术创建嵌入表示，以获得显著的重排序提升效果。

Result: 在Revisited Oxford和Paris数据集上达到了新的状态下最佳结果，展示了坚固的检索性能。

Conclusion: 本地到全局检索范式通过结合高效本地特征搜索和有效全局特征重排序，实现了更优异的图像检索性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的语言模型后训练主要使用在线（模型生成）和离线（人工演示）两种数据，分别对应RL和SFT方法。本文旨在证明这两种方法并非对立，而是同一优化过程的不同实例

Method: 推导了统一策略梯度估计器，将各种后训练方法表示为不同数据分布假设下的共同目标梯度。提出了混合后训练算法HPT，动态选择不同训练信号

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和两个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上都持续超越强基线方法

Conclusion: RL和SFT方法本质上是统一的，HPT算法能够有效利用演示数据并保持稳定探索，不牺牲已学习的推理模式

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型的成功使得社区创建了大量针对特定任务和领域微调的模型，但由于元数据不一致和存储库非结构化，导航和理解这些模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型的内部激活变化（Delta Activations）来表示模型，将其编码为向量嵌入，支持聚类分析和模型比较。

Result: Delta Activations能够有效按领域和任务对模型进行聚类，展现出良好的鲁棒性（对不同的微调设置都有效）和可加性（当微调数据集混合时）。该方法还可用于few-shot微调任务嵌入、模型选择和模型融合。

Conclusion: Delta Activations为理解和重用公开可用模型提供了有效工具，有助于促进模型复用实践，代码已开源。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Conclusion: 该问题框架和方法可推广到卫星图像机器学习的各个应用领域，特别适用于增强聚集农业调查数据以支持多哥的卫星监测应用

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Conclusion: 该方法为量化感知知识蒸馏中的数据增强选择提供了有效的解决方案，能够自动选择最优的数据增强策略，显著提升低精度模型的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Method: 提出FedQuad方法，显式优化跨客户端的较小类内方差和较大类间方差，最小化相似对距离同时最大化负对距离，在共享特征空间中解耦客户端数据

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，在不同数据分布和大量客户端设置下均表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 基于度量学习的策略在监督学习和联邦学习范式中都能有效解决联邦设置中的表示学习挑战

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

Motivation: 解决生成模型中迭代扩散模型计算成本高与少步生成模型质量受限的根本矛盾，突破传统训练目标对无限小动态或直接端点预测的局限。

Method: 引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解析定义任意有限时间间隔内的状态转换，提出Transition Models (TiM)生成范式，支持从单步跳跃到多步细化的任意步长转换。

Result: TiM仅用865M参数就超越了SD3.5(8B)和FLUX.1(12B)等领先模型在所有评估步数下的表现，并随着采样预算增加呈现单调质量提升，在4096x4096分辨率下表现出色。

Conclusion: TiM提供了一个统一的生成框架，能够灵活适应不同计算预算，在保持高效率的同时实现最先进的生成质量，为生成模型的发展开辟了新方向。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their

radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced

with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large

often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CoT-Space理论框架，将LLM推理从离散的token预测重新定义为连续语义空间中的优化过程，解释了最优CoT长度的收敛性及其在欠拟合和过拟合之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级别性质对齐，存在显著的理论空白。

Method: 引入CoT-Space框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，将LLM推理重新构建为连续推理级语义空间中的优化问题。

Result: 理论分析表明最优CoT长度的收敛是欠拟合和过拟合之间基本权衡的自然结果，大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力的实证验证。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为过度思考等经验现象提供了连贯解释，还为开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Conclusion: 该方法可无缝推广到其他心理学框架（如大五人格、HEXACO、九型人格），为心理学理论与LLM行为设计的融合提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种概念级外部记忆方法，通过从推理轨迹中提取可重用的模块化抽象概念，实现无需权重更新的测试时持续学习，在ARC-AGI基准上取得了7.5%的相对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在推理时产生的有价值模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后就被丢弃，需要一种更广泛可重用和可扩展的外部记忆机制来持久化这些发现。

Method: 提出概念级记忆方法：从解决方案轨迹中提取自然语言表示的模块化抽象概念，通过新的抽象化和检索策略，在查询时选择性检索并集成相关概念到提示中。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准上相对无记忆基线获得7.5%的性能提升，性能随推理计算量持续扩展，抽象概念在所有测试的计算规模上都优于基线。

Conclusion: 动态更新记忆在测试时优于固定记忆设置，证实了通过解决更多问题并向记忆抽象更多模式可以实现自我改进的形式。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Result: 在所有评估指标上都表现出优越性能，并提供了一个包含错误ASR转录的新基准数据集

Conclusion: CTD方法在语音查询纠正方面效果显著，为音频查询纠正提供了全面的评估基准

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

<details>

Motivation: 单图像或视频的光照估计是长期挑战，基于学习的方法受限于真实HDR环境贴图的稀缺性、获取成本高和多样性有限的问题

Method: 使用大型合成数据集训练视频扩散变换器，引入低秩适应微调策略提高输入与预测环境贴图的语义对齐

Result: 能够从间接视觉线索推断光照，有效泛化到真实场景，产生具有真实角度高频细节的准确光照预测

Conclusion: 在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进技术，为光照估计提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术需要大量3D高斯来获得高质量表示，但这显著增加了GPU内存需求，导致训练和渲染效率低下。需要一种方法在保持高斯数量的同时减少内存使用。

Method: 使用码本紧凑存储高斯参数向量，将参数估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，采用MCMC采样在压缩表示的后验分布上进行采样。

Result: 训练峰值内存平均减少3.49倍，训练和渲染速度分别平均提升1.36倍和1.88倍，同时保持接近最先进的质量。

Conclusion: ContraGS成功解决了在码本压缩表示上直接训练的挑战，实现了内存效率的大幅提升和性能加速，为3DGS的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Result: 方法在HeteroSynth测试集、烟雾云层形状和实际样品上都表现出有效的逆散射能力

Conclusion: 研究探索了Perlin噪声分布在模拟实际异质散射中的潜力，为前向式逆散射提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with

categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice

open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen

multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision

providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

TL;DR: LibriQuote是一个从有声读物中提取的英语语料库，包含12.7K小时非表达性语音和5.3K小时表达性语音，用于表达性零样本TTS系统的微调和基准测试


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语音语料库中表达性语音的比例不明确，且现有的表达性语音语料库规模较小，主要用于TTS系统的基准测试

Method: 从有声读物中提取语料，训练集包含非表达性和表达性语音，表达性子集还提供上下文语境和伪标签（如说话动词和副词），并提供7.5小时的测试集用于基准测试

Result: 定性验证显示测试集涵盖广泛的情感和口音，主观和客观评估表明在LibriQuote上微调TTS系统显著提高了合成语音的可懂度，现有系统无法合成与真实语音一样表达性和自然的语音

Conclusion: LibriQuote数据集为表达性TTS系统的开发和评估提供了有价值的资源，现有系统在表达性语音合成方面仍有改进空间

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

### [151] [No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404)

TL;DR: 这是一个简历筛选实验研究，研究人们与体现种族偏见的AI模型协作时的行为变化，发现AI偏见会影响人的决策，而驾驭联想测试可以减少这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人与AI协作决策中的偏见传播机制，以及隐性联想测试在减少AI偏见影响中的作用。

Method: 进行简历筛选实验(N=528)，使用模拟AI模型展现种族偏见，在1,526个场景中评估各种族群的借候人，并使用隐性联想测试(IATs)测量无意识偏见。

Result: 当AI展现偏见时，人们透弃AI偏向的借候人的概玉高达90%；完成IAT后，选择不符合种族-地位定型的借候人的概玉提高13%；即使人们认为AI建议质量低，仍受AI偏见影响。

Conclusion: 研究显示了AI-HITL决策中偏见传播的复杂性，建议组织和监管政策应考虑这种复杂性，并通过教育和监管来减少偏见影响。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.
