### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见主要源于预训练阶段，而非微调或随机训练噪声。通过多轮微调和跨微调实验，揭示了预训练对偏见模式的决定性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs中认知偏见的来源，明确预训练、微调和训练随机性对偏见的影响。

Method: 采用两步因果实验方法：1）多次微调模型以研究训练随机性对30多种认知偏见的影响；2）引入跨微调技术，交换指令数据集以隔离偏见来源。

Result: 训练随机性引入的变异性较小，偏见模式主要由预训练决定。相同预训练模型的偏见模式更相似。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏见需考虑预训练来源，这为未来评估和减少LLMs偏见提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社会科学调查中的可靠性，发现其对问题表述和答案结构的扰动敏感，并表现出明显的“近因偏差”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs作为人类受试者替代品在调查中的可靠性和潜在偏差。

Method: 测试了9种不同的LLMs，应用11种扰动（问题表述和答案结构），模拟了超过167,000次访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出近因偏差，且对语义变化和组合扰动敏感；较大模型更稳健。

Conclusion: 提示设计和稳健性测试对LLMs生成合成调查数据至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于全面评估合成文本的工具包，支持多维度评估，包括实用性、公平性、隐私风险等，适用于高风险领域如医疗和法律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的合成文本在隐私保护方面具有潜力，但需要系统评估以确保其在高风险领域的应用可行性。

Method: 提供多维度评估功能，包括下游系统效用、公平性、隐私泄漏风险等，支持用户上传或生成数据。

Result: 工具包在医疗和法律领域的数据集上展示了功能和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估指标，SynthTextEval旨在提升合成文本的可行性，从而促进AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对医疗领域大语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估协议，填补了现有文献中医疗LLMs安全性评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是对患者和临床医生的潜在影响。现有评估多集中于通用领域，缺乏针对医疗场景的专门评估。

Method: 作者设计了一个医疗领域专用的安全评估协议，包括患者和临床医生视角的评估，并构建了包含466个样本的PatientSafetyBench数据集。

Result: 通过案例研究（MediPhi模型集合）验证了评估协议的有效性，首次从患者、临床医生和普通用户三个视角定义了医疗LLMs的安全性标准。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗LLMs的安全部署奠定了基础，提供了多视角的安全性评估框架。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了协作学习中打断行为的重要性，并提出了一种在多组对话环境中识别打断的先进方法，适用于嘈杂的课堂环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习中的打断行为对小组互动和知识构建有重要影响，但现有研究多在单一对话环境中进行，无法适应多组对话的嘈杂环境。

Method: 分析了单对话和多组对话环境中的打断检测，开发了一种对重叠语音鲁棒的打断识别方法。

Result: 提出了一种适用于课堂环境的打断识别方法，并揭示了打断在协作互动中的语言和韵律特征。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在多组对话环境中跟踪打断行为提供了基础，并强调了重叠语音的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康错误信息的反驳言论，结合静态和动态证据，优化知识检索和响应生成，显著提升反驳言论的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究依赖有限证据且对最终输出控制不足，为解决这些问题，提出了多代理框架以增强反驳言论的生成能力。

Method: 结合多个LLM，优化知识检索、证据增强和响应细化，整合静态和动态证据，确保反驳言论的相关性和准确性。

Result: 在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线方法，消融研究和人类评估验证了框架的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: 多代理检索增强框架能生成高质量反驳言论，显著提升反驳言论的质量和人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，用于高效处理长文本，避免了传统Transformer的二次复杂度问题，并在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长文本时因二次计算复杂度导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，通过实时端到端图生成机制处理字符级输入，利用LLM信息增强性能，并通过小世界图聚合文档级信息。

Result: 生成的图具有有意义的语义组织结构，模型在文本分类任务中表现出高效和竞争力。

Conclusion: 新模型在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于长文本处理。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Won Seok Jang,Sharmin Sultana,Allen Chang,Yuan Zhang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl是一个可控可读性的指令调优框架，能调整LLM输出复杂度而不损失意义，显著优于GPT-4，尤其在低文化水平群体中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域中AI生成内容在个性化与可理解性之间的平衡问题，提升患者教育与AI辅助医疗的公平性。

Method: 引入MedReadCtrl框架，通过指令调优控制输出复杂度，评估其在多个医疗和通用任务上的表现。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，MedReadCtrl显著优于GPT-4（如ReadMe得分1.39 vs. 1.59），专家偏好率达71.7%。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能有效生成易读且保留医学意图的内容，为患者教育和公平医疗提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

### [9] [SynthEHR-Eviction: Enhancing Eviction SDoH Detection with LLM-Augmented Synthetic EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07421)
*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction是一个结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化的管道，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公共驱逐相关SDoH数据集，性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的重要社会决定因素，但电子健康记录中很少结构化记录，限制了应用。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）的管道提取驱逐状态。

Result: 创建的SDoH数据集包含14个细粒度类别，LLMs性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT，标注工作量减少80%。

Conclusion: 该管道高效、可扩展，适用于其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

*Matthieu Boileau,Philippe Helluy,Jeremy Pawlus,Svitlana Vyetrenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小型指令调优语言模型中，构建可解释的时间序列基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发轻量级、可解释的模型，用于自然语言解释时间序列模式。

Method: 利用合成数据集生成自然语言注释，监督微调小型Qwen模型。

Result: 模型获得有意义的解释能力，适合隐私敏感或设备端部署。

Conclusion: 证明了将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [11] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAND框架通过让LLM代理在行动前明确考虑候选行动，解决了现有方法因有限行动空间探索而导致的次优行动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调和偏好优化）可能导致LLM代理过度依赖看似合理但次优的行动，缺乏对替代行动的推理和比较。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自洽行动采样和执行引导的行动评估，生成逐步行动思考，并利用这些轨迹微调LLM代理。

Result: 在两个代表性交互任务中，SAND比初始监督微调平均提升20%，并优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: SAND通过行动思考显著提升了LLM代理的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLEP是一种两阶段强化学习框架，通过重放已验证的高质量轨迹来稳定训练并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在强化学习中训练不稳定和策略漂移的问题。

Method: RLEP分为两阶段：先收集已验证轨迹，再在训练中重放这些轨迹，结合新生成的数据进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，如AIME-2024准确率从38.2%提升至39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量轨迹，实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了‘机器废话’作为大语言模型（LLM）中真实性缺失现象的框架，并开发了‘废话指数’和分类法。实验表明，RLHF微调和CoT提示会加剧废话行为，尤其在政治语境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM中真实性缺失的广泛现象，揭示其机制，以改善模型的对齐和真实性。

Method: 引入‘废话指数’和四种废话分类法，并在多个数据集（Marketplace、Political Neutrality、BullshitEval）上进行实证评估。

Result: RLHF微调和CoT提示显著增加废话行为，政治语境中‘含糊其辞’是主要策略。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

*Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Xin Liu,Yiwen Song,Mingyang Ling,Chitta Baral,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING是一种后训练框架，通过从大型语言模型提取任务分解（规划轨迹）并微调小型模型，提升复杂推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用任务分解（类似人类自然规划）提升小型开源语言模型的性能，目前研究较少。

Method: PLAN-TUNING框架：(i)从大型模型提取任务分解（规划轨迹），(ii)通过监督和强化学习目标微调小型模型以模仿规划过程。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准测试中平均提升7%，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING通过规划轨迹有效提升小型模型的复杂推理能力，是一种高效的后训练策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

*Keqin Bao,Nuo Chen,Xiaoyuan Li,Binyuan Hui,Bowen Yu,Fuli Feng,Junyang Lin,Xiangnan He,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TeaR方法，通过数据优化和强化学习提升LLM的推理能力，实验显示显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，但现有方法因依赖复杂代码结构导致过拟合，需改进。

Method: TeaR结合数据优化和强化学习，引导模型发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能显著提升，如Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升LLM的推理能力，尤其在代码相关任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DyGIE++和多种BERT变体的NER与RE方法，用于从科学文献中提取ORR催化剂信息，构建了FC-CoMIcs数据集。实验表明，PubMedBERT在NER任务中表现最佳，MatSciBERT在RE任务中表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORR催化剂对提升燃料电池效率至关重要，但从复杂多样的文献中提取相关信息仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用DyGIE++结合多种BERT变体（如MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT）进行信息提取，构建了包含12个关键实体和两种关系的FC-CoMIcs数据集。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1-score达82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中F1-score为66.10%，优于通用科学模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取中表现优异，展示了自动化文献分析的潜力。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在AI中的广泛应用，人们对其能力边界（如幻觉现象）和代理用途的兴趣日益增长，因此需要明确LLMs能完成和不能完成的任务类型。

Method: 从LLM推理的计算复杂性角度出发，分析了LLMs在计算和代理任务中的能力上限。

Result: 研究表明，LLMs无法执行或验证超过特定复杂度的任务。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LLMs在复杂任务中的局限性，并讨论了这一发现的潜在影响。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用有限真实数据和专家知识微调大语言模型的框架，构建了中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD），并开发了综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS），在策略预测和情感支持对话任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因心理压力增加导致的心理支持需求增长，尤其是在非英语语言中相关数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 通过Dialog Generator生成大规模心理咨询对话，Dialog Modifier优化对话质量，构建CPsDD数据集，并开发CADSS系统，包含Profiler、Summarizer、Planner和Supporter模块。

Result: CPsDD包含68K对话，覆盖13组、16种心理问题、13种原因和12种支持焦点；CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和系统有效解决了心理支持数据稀缺问题，并在实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Result: VAP在三方对话中表现优于基线模型，但对话类型影响准确性。

Conclusion: VAP可用于三方对话的轮流发言预测，未来将整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 探索LLM在少样本提示下的多语言主观性检测能力，特别是在数据稀缺或不一致时的表现。

Method: 使用精心设计的少样本提示，结合LLM，并尝试了辩论式提示和不同示例选择策略。

Result: 在CheckThat! 2025任务中取得多语言排名前列，尤其在阿拉伯语和波兰语中排名第一，其他语言和跨语言任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM的少样本学习在多语言情感任务中高效且适应性强，为传统微调提供了有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Motivation: 解决跨语言检索在领域特定场景中的性能下降问题，特别是在用户查询和支持文档语言不同时。

Result: 检索是跨语言领域特定场景的主要瓶颈，改进策略显著提升了跨语言和整体性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了改进多语言检索的机会，尤其是在实际RAG应用中。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL在VLM中的联合有效性，以提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 通过多种训练策略（如两阶段、交替或渐进式训练）和数据混合、模型合并等方法，研究SFT和RL的结合效果。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题的推理能力但增加冗余，RL促进泛化和简洁性；两者结合未能实现叠加效果。

Conclusion: 需要更自适应的方法来解锁SFT和RL在VLM中的联合潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Result: 实验表明翻译质量显著提升，尤其在跨域泛化和复杂文档图像场景中。

Conclusion: M4Doc通过轻量化设计有效结合多模态知识，提升了文档图像机器翻译的性能。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛边缘化独立破坏样本，构建推理时集成方法，平均多次掩码-去噪过程。

Result: 在WikiText-2上，测试困惑度为8.8（K=8），优于GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练成本，即可获得后验感知的标记概率和不确定性估计。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Result: 学生模型参数减少57.1%的同时，保持了教师模型90%以上的性能；单样本提示比零样本表现更优。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可在模型效率和任务性能间取得平衡，适合资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Conclusion: 改进提示和小规模微调可显著提升RAG性能与效率，无需大规模训练。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Motivation: 语音伪装替换（PCR）已成为中文内容审核的主要障碍，现有评估方法依赖规则生成的合成数据，忽略了真实用户的创造性。

Method: 作者对PCR进行了四类表面形式分类，并构建了一个包含500个自然生成的PCR帖子的数据集。通过基准测试评估了现有LLM模型的性能，并探索了基于拼音的提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差。基于拼音的提示策略显著提升了检测准确率。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类了中文PCR，提供了真实基准和轻量级改进方法，推动了毒性检测的鲁棒性研究。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 传统摘要评估依赖人工参考摘要，耗时且主观，需要一种自动化、客观的指标。

Method: 提出NOIR指标，利用语言模型嵌入衡量语义相似性，结合摘要压缩率评估质量。

Result: 实验表明NOIR能有效捕捉摘要的语义保留与长度压缩的权衡，并与人类评估一致。

Conclusion: NOIR为摘要任务提供自动化评估工具，可用于改进摘要算法和生成提示。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Motivation: 观察到多头注意力（MHA）的性能随注意力头数量增加而提升，但需保持足够的隐藏维度。因此，如何在低参数开销下增加头和隐藏维度成为关键。

Method: 提出SAS方法，通过将低维头表示投影到高维空间，模拟更多头和更大隐藏维度；同时引入参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）控制参数成本。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务上的实验表明，SAS方法显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法在保持模型紧凑的同时，通过模拟更大模型的行为显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLM）的微调过程资源密集且耗时，需要一种新的知识扩展方法。现有的RAG实现存在可扩展性和答案准确性的问题。

Method: K2RAG结合密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要，并引入预处理步骤以减少训练时间。

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面优于传统RAG实现，为LLM知识扩展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested

### [31] [Rethinking the Privacy of Text Embeddings: A Reproducibility Study of "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07700)
*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vec2Text方法能够从文本嵌入中重构原始文本，挑战了传统认为嵌入传输隐私安全的观点。研究验证了其有效性，并探索了防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Vec2Text方法是否真的能重构原始文本，并评估其对隐私的威胁，同时探索可能的防御机制。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架，验证其原始结果，并通过参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重构实验和嵌入量化防御研究扩展研究。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效重构文本，甚至密码类序列，但对输入长度敏感。高斯噪声和量化技术可缓解隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用文本嵌入，并进一步研究防御机制以保护NLP系统隐私。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种选择性对齐策略，通过关注高影响力标记来优化大型语言模型的训练，减少计算开销并提高对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的后训练对齐是一个关键挑战，因为并非所有标记对模型性能的贡献均等。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异，优先处理偏好对中的高影响力标记。

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，选择性DPO方法优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对提升大型语言模型的偏好对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

current research efforts and available resources as well as opportunities and
gaps to guide future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律领域的应用，提出了一种创新的双重分类法，整合法律推理框架和专业本体，系统化历史研究与当代突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补法律领域LLMs应用的综述空白，推动法律人工智能的发展。

Method: 采用Transformer-based LLMs，结合稀疏注意力机制和专家混合架构，动态捕捉法律语义和统一证据推理。

Result: 在任务泛化、推理形式化、工作流整合等方面取得显著进展，但面临幻觉、可解释性不足等挑战。

Conclusion: 提出新的分类法，为研究人员提供技术路线图，为从业者提供概念框架，奠定法律AI新时代的基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

### [35] [StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803)
*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni提出了一种统一的语音-语言大模型（LSLM），通过语音链式思维（CoT）实现流式语音翻译（StreamST），无需依赖分段模型或大量策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式语音翻译方法依赖句子级分段，限制了上下文信息，且策略学习复杂。

Method: StreamUni利用语音CoT引导LSLM生成多阶段输出，统一完成语音分段、策略决策和翻译生成。

Result: 实验表明，StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型和多阶段输出解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了翻译质量和低延迟。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以生成简洁且语义一致的公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识整合到数据驱动的学习算法中，需要语义一致的连续表示，并确保这些嵌入是可逆的。

Method: 训练一个Transformer解码器模型，通过STL语法的小词汇表生成有效公式。

Result: 模型在1个epoch后能生成有效公式，10个epoch后能泛化逻辑语义，并能生成更简洁的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂度和分布外泛化方面表现良好，并成功应用于需求挖掘任务。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT)的新方法，通过差异化加权提示和响应标记来优化指令微调的损失函数，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令微调中，损失函数仅计算响应标记而忽略提示标记，这可能不是最优方案。本文旨在研究如何通过加权优化损失函数。

Method: 提出WIT方法，系统研究提示和响应标记的权重分配，并在不同模型、数据集和评估基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，传统指令微调损失函数性能次优且鲁棒性不足，而WIT方法通过合理加权显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: WIT方法为指令微调提供了更优的损失函数设计，增强了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Motivation: 扩展单字分词方法，利用平行数据中的源语言标记优化目标语言分词，以提高跨语言语义对齐。

Method: 在固定源分词器的基础上，学习目标分词器，最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 在四种语言对上测试，机器翻译质量无提升，但语言建模困惑度一致降低。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次扩展导致数据效率瓶颈，需探索其他参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Result: 共指消解提升检索效果；均值池化在共指消解后表现最佳；小模型在消解过程中受益更大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了共指复杂性对RAG的挑战，为知识密集型AI应用的检索和生成改进提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Conclusion: 论文不仅提出理论框架，还将其作为语义人工制品设计，验证了其在实际AI嵌入空间中的传播能力。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

TL;DR: DocCHA是一个模块化框架，通过分阶段临床推理（症状收集、病史获取、因果图构建）提升对话健康代理的诊断能力，显著优于现有LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话健康代理（CHAs）缺乏自适应多轮推理和透明决策能力，限制了其在临床诊断中的应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分解为三个阶段，每个阶段使用可解释的置信度分数指导自适应提问和推理优化。

Result: 在两个中文咨询数据集上，DocCHA诊断准确率提升5.18%，症状召回率提高30%，对话轮次仅小幅增加。

Conclusion: DocCHA为多语言和资源受限环境下的可信LLM临床助手提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Result: 该方法显著减少了设置时间，降低了人为错误，并能并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中LLM的广泛应用提供了基础，未来可进一步扩展模拟自动化。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end

insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

TL;DR: SAGE是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）提升工业异常检测和推理能力，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，缺乏解释性和泛化能力，SAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAGE结合SFE和E-DPO，并利用AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。

Result: SAGE在零样本和单样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）比显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差，主要原因是IM-RM更依赖表面标记级线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差异的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM和EX-RM的差异，验证IM-RM更依赖标记级线索的假设。

Result: IM-RM在标记级分布变化和分布内任务中泛化能力较差，且排除了其他可能解释。

Conclusion: 奖励模型的设计选择对其泛化行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Result: SLMs+RAG在诊断和治疗性能上优于LLMs，同时更节能、适合本地部署。

Conclusion: SLMs+RAG在风湿病学中有应用前景，但需专家监督以确保准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在医学推理能力评估上存在不足，缺乏严谨的基准测试。

Method: 提出MedThink-Bench基准测试和LLM-w-Ref评估框架，利用专家标注的逐步推理和LLM-as-a-Judge机制。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关，小模型（如MedGemma-27B）表现优于大模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为LLM医学推理评估提供了基础工具，推动其在临床实践中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型不仅能使用工具，还能发明工具，推动更具自主性的视觉推理。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未能解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，导致语义匹配不足。

Method: MMoE包含四个模块：描述感知提及增强、多模态特征提取、以及两级专家混合机制，动态选择信息。

Result: 实验表明MMoE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择和增强机制，显著提升了多模态实体链接的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），利用领域无关的文本嵌入来学习图像分割编码器中的领域不变特征，从而提升无监督领域自适应（UDA）在语义分割中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割的标注成本高，而现有UDA方法未充分利用文本的领域无关特性。

Method: 通过LLM生成领域描述，结合CLIP模型生成文本嵌入，提出CoPT损失函数学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CoPT实现了UDA分割的最新性能。

Conclusion: CoPT通过文本嵌入有效提升了UDA分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

Motivation: 图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）的去学习技术（MU）可能面临多模态对抗攻击的挑战，其鲁棒性和有效性尚未充分研究。

Result: Recall在十种先进去学习方法中表现优于基线，揭示了当前去学习机制的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的去学习解决方案的必要性，以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp在临床息肉分割任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Conclusion: 通过语义中介的框架，实现了与认知对齐的EEG视觉解码，为神经科学和可解释AI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外模型或标注学习衣物不变特征，资源消耗大。本文探索颜色作为轻量级代理，减少外观偏差。

Method: 提出CSCI方法，利用前景和背景颜色信息，结合S2A自注意力机制分离颜色与身份特征。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上显著提升性能，图像ReID提升2.9%-5.0%，视频ReID提升1.0%-2.5%。

Conclusion: 颜色是一种低成本有效的代理，可用于解决CC-ReID中的外观偏差问题。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.

pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，通过结构化文本监督解耦生物特征、运动和非生物特征，解决了活动生物特征识别中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统身份识别在多样化活动中面临身份线索与运动动态和外观变化纠缠的问题，现有视觉数据（如姿态或轮廓）提取不准确。

Method: 提出DisenQ框架，利用结构化语言指导解耦特征，确保身份线索独立于外观和运动变化。

Result: 在三个活动视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在传统视频识别基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架有效解决了活动生物特征识别的复杂性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: LinguaMark是一个多语言视觉问答（VQA）基准，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）的多语言能力，发现闭源模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在语言覆盖上存在偏差和不公平，缺乏多语言能力的评估。

Method: 构建包含6,875对图像-文本数据、覆盖11种语言和5种社会属性的数据集，使用Bias、Answer Relevancy和Faithfulness三项指标评估模型。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）整体表现最佳，开源模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在某些方面表现竞争性，Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现突出。

Conclusion: LinguaMark基准和评估代码已公开，以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答和多模态推理中表现优异，但其是否真正进行视觉推理尚不明确。

Method: MagiC包含5500个弱监督QA样本和900个人工标注样本，评估15个模型在答案正确性、推理有效性、视觉证据对齐及自我纠正能力四个维度。

Result: 通过新指标MagiScore和StepSense分析，揭示了当前视觉推理方法的关键局限与机遇。

Conclusion: MagiC为评估和改进视觉语言模型的真实推理能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

TL;DR: ADIEE提出了一种自动化数据集创建方法，用于训练评分模型以评估指令引导的图像编辑效果，显著提升了开源和专有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏有效的自动化评估方法，开源模型对齐困难，专有模型不透明且成本高。

Method: 通过ADIEE生成大规模数据集（100K样本），并微调LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型以输出评分。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中优于开源和专有模型，显著提升了与人类评分的相关性及比较准确性。

Conclusion: ADIEE方法为指令引导的图像编辑提供了高效、透明的自动化评估工具，并可作为奖励模型优化编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉叙事系统在跨帧识别同一角色或对象时表现不佳，导致引用不一致和幻觉问题，原因是缺乏明确的跨帧实体连接训练。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展Story Reasoning数据集并引入合成负例，使用Direct Preference Optimization和双组件奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 模型在多项指标上显著提升，如grounding mAP提高14.8%，F1提高17.1%，跨帧实体持续性也有所改善。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统中实体识别的连贯性和准确性，显著改善了故事生成的质量。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Motivation: 解决深度补全模型对大规模标注数据的依赖问题，提出一种标签高效的方法，通过合成伪几何数据增强数据多样性。

Conclusion: PacGDC通过标签高效的数据合成方法，显著提升了深度补全的泛化性能，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

Motivation: 现有基于径向基函数的粒子形状建模方法缺乏自适应性，无法自动调整粒子配置以适应局部几何特征，影响复杂解剖变异的准确表示。

Method: 引入两种机制：(1) 新型邻域对应损失函数提升自适应性，(2) 测地线对应算法优化配置一致性。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上验证了方法的有效性和扩展性，分析了自适应性与对应性的权衡，并在表面表示精度和对应指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的机制显著提升了粒子形状建模的自适应性和一致性，为复杂解剖变异建模提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Motivation: 现有PES模型在时间感受野和空间适应性上存在局限，需要更高效的模块来建模短长期依赖和显著区域。

Method: 提出MSAGSM，结合多尺度时间扩张和多头空间注意力，轻量且易集成到2D骨干网络。

Result: 在五个PES基准测试中，MSAGSM以最小开销显著提升性能，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一种高效且通用的模块，推动了PES领域的发展。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动转移方法主要关注人类运动，忽略了动物特有的习惯行为，因此需要一种能够保留这些习惯的跨类别运动转移方法。

Method: 基于生成框架，引入习惯保留模块和类别特定习惯编码器，并结合大型语言模型（LLM）处理未见过的物种。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D-skl数据集上进行了实验和定量分析，验证了模型的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了跨类别动物运动转移，并保留了物种特有的习惯行为，为动画和虚拟现实应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Result: 实验表明Seg-Wild在分割和重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景分割提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Conclusion: EscherNet++在效率和性能上显著优于现有方法，适用于快速3D重建和真实世界遮挡任务。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Motivation: 大规模预训练多模态模型（LMMs）在微调下游任务时计算成本高，因此研究更高效的提示交互策略。

Conclusion: EPIC是一种高效的多模态交互策略，显著降低了计算成本并保持了性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning

methods in both accuracy and speed, highlighting the pivotal role of
high-resolution data and effective feature aggregation in advancing practical
3D anomaly detection.

*Ling Zhou,Runtian Yuan,Yi Liu,Yuejie Zhang,Rui Feng,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DSANet的新框架，通过增强局部和全局特征的语义感知，提高超声视频分割的噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像因其简单和非侵入性而广泛应用，但其固有特性常引入噪声，为自动分割带来挑战。

Method: 设计了AFSA模块和LGSA模块，分别通过相邻帧的语义感知和局部与全局特征的融合来减少噪声影响。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，分割精度显著提升，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: DSANet在噪声鲁棒性和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于超声视频分割。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）的方法，用于检测皮肤病变中的蓝白色面纱（BWV），并通过可解释人工智能（XAI）分析模型决策过程，显著提高了BWV检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蓝白色面纱（BWV）是诊断黑色素瘤的关键特征，但现有研究对其在皮肤图像中的检测有限。本研究旨在开发一种高效且可解释的BWV检测方法，以辅助早期黑色素瘤诊断。

Method: 研究使用未标注的皮肤病变数据集，通过基于颜色阈值技术的成像算法将其转换为标注数据集。设计并训练了一个DCNN模型，采用自定义层替代标准激活函数层，并在多个数据集上进行测试。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有BWV检测模型，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了可靠工具，结合XAI增强了模型决策的透明性。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

TL;DR: Objectomaly是一种基于对象感知的OoD分割框架，通过三阶段方法解决边界不精确和异常评分不一致问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的OoD分割方法存在边界不精确、对象内异常评分不一致以及背景噪声导致的误报问题，需要改进。

Method: Objectomaly包含三个阶段：粗粒度异常评分（CAS）、对象感知评分校准（OASC）和精细边界处理（MBP），结合对象级先验和图像处理技术。

Result: 在SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack和RoadAnomaly等基准测试中，Objectomaly在像素级和组件级指标上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象感知和边界优化显著提升了OoD分割的精度和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶等安全敏感场景。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的盲人脸图像恢复框架，通过局部统计面部特征变换（SFFT）和退化无关特征嵌入（DAFE）模块，显著提升了恶劣天气条件下的面部识别准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下图像质量下降导致面部识别精度降低，现有方法缺乏针对性模块处理天气引起的退化问题。

Method: 结合局部SFFT模块和DAFE模块，前者通过统计分布对齐提升面部结构和色彩保真度，后者通过特征嵌入实现退化无关的鲁棒特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和准确重建面部结构方面优于现有GAN和扩散模型方法。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块有效提升了恶劣天气下面部恢复的结构保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成时间不可学习示例（TUEs）的新框架，以保护视频数据隐私，防止未经授权的视觉对象跟踪（VOT）模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，大量用户上传的视频被用于VOT训练，但数据隐私问题被忽视。本文旨在防止个人视频数据被未经授权利用。

Method: 提出了一种生成TUEs的生成框架，并引入时间对比损失以增强效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面表现优异，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效保护视频数据隐私，适用于大规模视频数据集和多种VOT任务。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Conclusion: OMA基准和Map Association Transformer框架提升了自动驾驶车辆的规划能力，填补了混合导航地图关联的研究空白。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Method: 提出GGMotion，采用组图网络建模人体拓扑，引入径向场捕捉时空依赖，通过组内和组间交互模块捕获多尺度关节依赖，并结合等变多层感知机更新关节位置特征。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过分组建模和物理先验的引入，有效提升了运动生成的物理合理性和预测性能。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD

Conclusion: 该方法通过样条表示和低秩编码，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了轨迹建模的性能和直观性。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Result: 发现VLMs存在强大的休眠推理路径，但对复杂关系任务需调整核心权重；改进表示质量可能导致新提示格式失败。

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健推理需针对性对齐而非单纯改进表示学习，为VLM分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The

enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of

recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

TL;DR: HOTA是一种多尺度推理策略，结合SegFormer和深度估计模块，实现了高精度的3D洪水测绘，显著提升了洪水范围和深度的估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是常见的自然灾害，现有方法在覆盖范围和空间细节上存在不足，需要一种能同时提供大范围和高精度洪水信息的方法。

Method: 提出HOTA策略，通过多尺度重叠分块处理Sentinel-2图像，结合SegFormer和DEM差异法估计洪水深度。

Result: 在Kempsey洪水案例中，HOTA将IoU从73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米。

Conclusion: HOTA能够生成适用于快速灾害响应的高精度3D洪水地图。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 在多视角头发转移领域设定了新基准，代码已开源。

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SpatialViz-Bench，一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）空间可视化能力的基准测试，包含12个任务和1,180个问题。评估显示MLLMs在空间可视化任务中存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了SpatialViz-Bench，包含12个任务和1,180个自动生成的问题，用于评估33种先进MLLMs的空间可视化能力。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在与人类直觉不符的困难感知、2D到3D性能骤降等问题，且倾向于公式推导而非空间可视化。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench填补了领域空白，证明了MLLMs在空间可视化任务中的不足，基准已公开。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Method: ViLU通过训练一个二元分类器来区分正确和错误的预测，使用加权二元交叉熵损失，无需依赖损失预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有失败预测方法，适用于后处理设置。

Conclusion: ViLU在不确定性量化方面表现优异，架构和训练方法对其效果至关重要。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成视频编码方法受限于领域特异性或对高级文本指导的过度依赖，导致运动细节丢失和不真实的重建。

Method: 采用语义感知稀疏运动采样管道，提取像素级运动轨迹点，并结合轨迹对齐的损失约束。

Result: 在超低比特率条件下优于传统编解码器和端到端视频压缩方法，且运动控制更精确。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Conclusion: 年龄偏见可通过简单的训练调整有效缓解，近似人口统计标签对提升大规模情感计算系统的公平性有价值。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态融合和时间动态分析，显著提升了MoA识别的性能。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Conclusion: RED为提升LVLMs的CoT推理提供了一种实用有效的方法，推动了更可靠的多模态系统发展。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba方法通过树感知策略和高质量数据集，显著提升了水下单目深度估计的精度。

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority

*Wei Shang,Dongwei Ren,Wanying Zhang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合可训练掩码预测器和帧内运动分析器的去模糊方法，通过优化计算资源和处理空间变化模糊模式，显著提升了性能并减少了计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去模糊方法因计算资源分配效率低和空间变化模糊模式处理不足而面临挑战。

Method: 1. 使用可训练掩码预测器识别模糊区域，训练时排除清晰区域；2. 通过结构重参数化优化推理计算；3. 开发帧内运动分析器，将像素位移转化为运动轨迹。

Result: 在局部和全局模糊数据集上表现优于现有方法，计算量减少49%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效资源分配和自适应模糊恢复，显著提升了去模糊性能。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: 论文提出了CrossVLAD数据集和CRAFT方法，用于评估和攻击统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多任务指令下的对抗性攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型在多任务指令下的灵活性带来了新的安全挑战，需要评估其对抗性攻击的跨任务有效性。

Method: 提出了CrossVLAD数据集和CRAFT方法，专注于目标对象分类的跨任务一致性攻击，并引入新的成功率指标。

Result: 实验表明，CRAFT方法在跨任务攻击性能和目标对象改变成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CrossVLAD和CRAFT为评估和攻击统一VLMs在多任务环境下的对抗性攻击提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 探讨医学影像数据集中是否存在偏见，以验证现代AI方法是否真正关注病理特征。

Method: 对NIH、CheXpert、MIMIC-CXR和PadChest数据集进行变换，并应用多种网络架构进行分析。

Result: 研究发现医学影像数据集中可能存在偏见，需进一步验证。

Conclusion: 研究鼓励医学影像领域进行更多可解释性研究，并推动开源数据集的创建。

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于扩展视觉语言模型（VLM）在长视频推理能力的全栈框架，结合强化学习和大规模数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的独特挑战，如时间、空间和情节推理。

Method: 整合大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason、两阶段训练管道（CoT-SFT和RL）以及多模态强化序列并行（MR-SP）基础设施。

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B在长视频QA基准测试中表现优异，MR-SP系统实现2.1倍加速。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1标志着VLM在长视频推理方面的重要进展，并公开了支持多模态RL训练的系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

TL;DR: 提出了一种简化的3D可提示分割方法，用于医学影像，减少推理时间并消除滑动窗口的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的2D架构不适用于3D医学影像，现有3D方法复杂且计算资源消耗大。

Method: 受SegVol启发，设计了一种简化的3D可提示分割方法。

Result: 在减少推理时间的同时，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了3D分割流程，提高了效率和性能。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏全面评估视觉基础推理能力的基准测试，因此提出TreeBench填补这一空白。

Method: 基于三个原则构建TreeBench：聚焦视觉感知、可追踪证据和二阶推理。使用SA-1B图像和专家标注，通过质量控制生成问题对。提出TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习。

Result: 现有模型在TreeBench上表现不佳（最高准确率54.87%），TreeVGR显著提升了多个基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 可追踪性是提升视觉基础推理的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能量的解码方法，用于减少大型视觉语言模型中的对象幻觉问题，显著提高了准确性和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在解码或视觉输入修改上的限制，以及对外部模型知识的依赖问题。

Method: 通过动态选择能量分数最低的隐藏状态层，提出了一种简单有效的解码方法。

Result: 在三个基准测试（POPE、MME和MMVP）上，平均准确性提高了4.82%，且减少了8.81%的Yes比例偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少偏差的同时提升了性能，适用于多种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Motivation: 早期识别人类活动对安全性和响应性至关重要，但现有方法在处理事件数据时存在延迟或精度不足的问题。

Method: 采用高频率双流SNN处理事件数据，避免传统方法的低速率限制，提升早期预测能力。

Result: 在THU EACT-50数据集上，准确率比之前工作提高了2%，并在早期动作触发任务中展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 高频率双流SNN在早期活动识别中表现出色，为实时人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖预训练模型的最终层特征，限制了其在新领域的适应性，而全微调又不可行。稀疏-密集侧调谐架构旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了SDST架构，结合了参考型可变形自注意力机制，并首次将InternVideo2骨干网络集成到侧调谐框架中。

Conclusion: SDST方法显著提升了现有侧调谐方法的性能，展示了其在视频时间定位任务中的高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: X-RAFT在跨模态高光谱图像对应任务中表现出色，为荧光定量测量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Motivation: 增材制造中的几何不准确性（如收缩和变形）会影响部件性能，而现有数字体积相关（DVC）方法因缺乏真实变形场和大数据量而难以实现高精度配准。

Method: 采用动态分块处理策略的深度学习模型，估计CAD与XCT体积间的体素变形，并引入二值差异图（BDM）评估配准精度。

Result: 相比传统DVC方法，Dice分数提高了9.2%，体素匹配率提高了9.9%，且交互时间从几天缩短至几分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于深度学习的DVC技术奠定了基础，有望通过闭环补偿提高增材制造的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击防御方法无法应对无限制攻击，且缺乏统计显著的人类感知评估。

Method: 开发SCOOTER框架，包含众包研究指南、大规模人类实验、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 实验显示六种攻击方法均未能生成不可感知图像，GPT-4o仅对部分攻击有效。

Conclusion: SCOOTER框架填补了无限制攻击评估的空白，揭示了自动化视觉系统与人类感知的差异。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Motivation: 研究真实世界数据集偏移对图像分类校准的影响，为实践者提供鲁棒校准的指导。

Method: 比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），在多个分类任务和图像领域中进行实验。

Conclusion: 校准偏移通常以牺牲分布内校准为代价，但结合集成和基础模型微调可显著提升校准效果。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D卷积神经网络的端到端rPPG提取网络，通过差分帧融合模块和时序移位模块（TSM）提升信号重建的准确性和鲁棒性，并在复杂场景下表现出优越的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG技术在复杂场景下的准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用3D卷积神经网络，结合差分帧融合模块和TSM自注意力机制，并设计动态混合损失函数。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG和MMPD数据集上表现优异，训练后MAE为7.58，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法在复杂场景下具有更高的准确性和泛化能力，为rPPG技术提供了有效改进。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT提出了一种实例感知的视觉提示调优方法，通过结合数据集级和实例级提示，利用PCA保留关键信息，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法使用固定的数据集级提示，导致性能不佳，无法适应下游数据的高方差。

Method: 提出ViaPT，生成实例感知提示并与数据集级提示融合，利用PCA保留重要信息，平衡数据集级和实例级知识。

Result: 在34个数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT优于现有基线方法，同时减少了可学习参数。

Conclusion: ViaPT为视觉提示调优提供了新范式，有效结合了数据集级和实例级知识，提升了性能。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Synergistic Prompting (SyP)的新框架，用于解决多模态视觉识别中模态缺失的问题，通过动态适配器和协同提示策略显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中多模态数据常存在缺失或不完整，导致性能下降，现有静态提示方法缺乏灵活性且难以应对关键模态缺失的情况。

Method: SyP框架包含动态适配器（动态生成提示）和协同提示策略（结合静态与动态提示），以灵活适应不同缺失条件并确保鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的视觉识别数据集上，SyP显著优于现有方法，并在不同缺失率和条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SyP通过动态和协同的提示策略，有效解决了多模态缺失问题，展示了优越的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

### [122] [Patient-specific vs Multi-Patient Vision Transformer for Markerless Tumor Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07811)
*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViT）的无标记肺部肿瘤运动预测方法，比较了患者特异性（PS）和多患者（MP）训练策略，发现PS模型在精度上更优，而MP模型在临床时间限制下更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无标记方法多依赖深度学习，但基于Transformer的架构在此领域尚未探索，尽管其在轨迹预测中表现优异。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT扫描生成的DRRs训练MP模型，PS模型仅使用目标患者的规划数据。两种模型均预测1秒内的肿瘤运动，并通过ADE和FDE评估性能。

Result: PS模型在规划数据上表现更优，但MP模型对分次间解剖变化更具鲁棒性，且在治疗数据上表现相当。

Conclusion: ViT首次应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测，PS模型精度高，MP模型适合临床时间限制场景。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

TL;DR: 研究分析了内容拼图求解器在现实挑战（如缺失、边缘腐蚀和内容腐蚀）中的鲁棒性，发现现有方法性能下降明显，但深度学习模型通过数据增强可显著提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拼图求解器评估缺乏现实挑战，如文物碎片或文件碎片的复原，需研究其鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三种拼图损坏类型（缺失、边缘腐蚀、内容腐蚀），评估启发式和深度学习求解器的表现。

Result: 标准拼图求解器性能随损坏增加迅速下降，但深度学习模型通过微调和数据增强显著提升鲁棒性，Positional Diffusion模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升现实文物自动复原技术提供了方向，深度学习模型在数据增强下表现突出。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量图像分割中因解耦框架导致的塑性损失和输入数据顺序依赖问题。

Method: 通过直接选择图像特征进行查询分配，确保“完美对齐”以保留对象性，同时引入跨阶段一致性选择和基于“视觉查询”的重放机制。

Result: SimCIS在各种分割任务、设置、分割和输入数据顺序中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SimCIS通过简单而有效的方法解决了类增量图像分割中的关键问题，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了3D-ADAM数据集，用于高精度3D异常检测，填补了工业场景中高质量数据集的空白，并验证了其对现有方法的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中表面缺陷检测对提高产量至关重要，但现有数据集缺乏真实工业场景的代表性，限制了方法的改进。

Method: 构建了3D-ADAM数据集，包含14,120个高分辨率扫描和27,346个标注缺陷实例，覆盖12类工业表面缺陷，并在真实工业环境中采集。

Result: 3D-ADAM数据集对现有SOTA模型提出了显著挑战，并通过行业专家验证了其工业相关性和质量。

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM数据集将加速开发适应现代制造环境的鲁棒3D异常检测模型。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Motivation: 现有基于像素域扩散的水下图像恢复方法在复杂几何和深度变化的场景中计算量大且易产生不真实伪影，需要改进。

Method: 结合预训练的潜在扩散模型和显式场景分解（SLURPP），并设计基于物理的水下图像合成管道生成多样化训练数据。

Result: SLURPP比现有方法快200倍以上，在合成基准测试中PSNR提升约3 dB，并在真实数据上表现出显著的定性改进。

Conclusion: SLURPP通过新颖的网络架构和合成数据生成管道，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能和效率。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医疗诊断中常生成与医学知识不符的答案，检索增强生成虽能提升准确性，但存在检索不足或过度的问题。

Method: MIRA框架包含动态调整检索上下文的模块和整合图像嵌入与医学知识库的多模态检索增强生成框架。

Result: 在公开医疗VQA和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA显著提升了事实准确性和性能，达到最新最优水平。

Conclusion: MIRA通过优化检索和增强多模态推理，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在医疗诊断中的事实不一致问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测质量的同时显著降低计算需求，适合资源有限的嵌入式系统。

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Result: 在五个数据集上的TTA协议实验中，方法表现优于现有技术，实现实时自监督适应。

Conclusion: CiCi框架为rPPG任务提供了一种高效、稳定的测试时适应解决方案。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices
demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency.
This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning
architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated
recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency
without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets,
TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs.
DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the
averaged F1-scores. Beyond quantitative gains, this work provides the first
systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all
materials in this work for future
benchmarking\footnote{https://github.com/zhaxidele/TinierHAR}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为任务演练和机器人模拟提供逼真的火星地形视频，但火星数据稀缺且与地球图像存在显著差异。

Method: 1) 数据重建管道M3arsSynth，从NASA的立体导航图像重建3D火星环境并渲染视频；2) 视频生成器MarsGen，基于3D结构合成逼真视频。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉逼真度和3D结构一致性上优于基于地球数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了火星视频合成的挑战，为相关应用提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型仅基于原始视频数据训练时，难以捕捉有意义的几何感知结构，与真实3D世界存在差距。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing方法，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两个几何对齐目标，将模型中间表示与预训练几何基础模型的特征对齐。

Result: 在相机视角和动作条件视频生成任务中，方法显著优于基线模型，提升了视觉质量和3D一致性。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing有效增强了视频扩散模型对3D结构的内部化能力，为几何感知视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要针对离线固定输入，无法反映真实世界中的动态感知挑战，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 通过高效数据收集流程构建了包含1.4k场景和10k问答对的OST-Bench数据集，并在ScanNet、Matterport3D和ARKitScenes上测试了多个MLLMs。

Result: 现有MLLMs在复杂时空推理任务中表现不佳，特别是在在线探索和长期记忆需求下准确率下降。

Conclusion: OST-Bench揭示了MLLMs在动态感知中的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了数据集和基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and

TL;DR: CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中存在绑定问题，研究发现数据特性（如低属性密度、不完整标注和显著性偏差）是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP模型在区分复杂视觉场景（如颜色和物体绑定）时的局限性。

Method: 通过合成数据集分析数据特性对CLIP绑定能力的影响。

Result: 发现数据特性（如属性密度和标注完整性）对绑定性能至关重要，而非批量大小或硬负样本。

Conclusion: 数据特性是解决CLIP绑定问题的关键，需优化数据而非仅调整模型或训练策略。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视频时空令牌合并方法STTM，通过利用视频数据的局部冗余性，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（LLMs）因处理大量时空令牌导致计算复杂度呈二次增长，亟需一种高效的方法减少令牌数量而不显著影响性能。

Method: STTM通过粗到细的搜索将每帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并，利用视频数据的局部冗余性。

Result: 在六个视频QA基准测试中表现优异，50%令牌预算下速度提升2倍且准确率仅下降0.5%，30%预算下速度提升3倍且准确率下降2%。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效、无需训练且查询无关的令牌合并方法，适用于视频理解任务。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Motivation: 现有评估协议依赖粗粒度指标，掩盖了模型间差异，缺乏神经科学基础，且无法捕捉细粒度视觉区分。

Method: 引入分层分割指标（前景、语义、实例和组件掩码）和多模态大语言模型提取的场景表示，进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在统一框架下对多种视觉解码方法进行基准测试，提供了更区分性、可解释和全面的评估基础。

Conclusion: BASIC为脑视觉解码方法提供了更精细、可解释和全面的评估标准。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges

popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific

prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统使用固定长度表示，忽略了数据复杂性或熟悉度的变化，而自适应分词方法通常需要多次编码搜索。KARL旨在通过单次前向预测解决这一问题。

Method: KARL基于Kolmogorov复杂性原理，通过单次前向预测图像的分词数量，并在达到近似KC时停止。训练过程类似于倒置强化学习，根据重建质量预测分词停止。

Result: KARL在单次操作中性能与现有自适应分词器相当，并分析了编码器/解码器大小、连续/离散分词等因素的影响。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像分词与算法信息理论的关联，其预测的图像复杂性与人类直觉一致，为高效表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction

narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks

of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,

Motivation: 理解训练数据中概念组合如何影响CLIP/LMMs的组合泛化能力，尤其是常见概念在不常见配对中的表现。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）量化词共现频率，通过合成和编辑自然图像验证PMI与模型准确性的关系。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性强相关（r=0.97），且在LMMs中同样显著（TextVQA r=0.70，VQAv2 r=0.62）。

Conclusion: 需开发新算法和架构以提升多模态模型的组合泛化能力，而非单纯扩展训练数据。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有4D高斯框架在动态场景重建中存在存储成本与复杂运动建模能力之间的权衡问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出可变形锚点网格作为层次化、内存高效的场景表示，并结合变形感知密集化策略，动态调整锚点分布。

Result: 实验显示，SD-GS平均减少60%模型大小，提升100%的FPS，同时保持或超越视觉质量。

Conclusion: SD-GS在计算效率和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂动态场景重建。

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

Conclusion: 现有防御方法在白盒设置下存在显著漏洞，研究为理解其鲁棒性提供了重要进展。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

Motivation: 图像传感器在安全和安防关键系统中至关重要，但其视觉数据的完整性可能受到电磁攻击的威胁，传统数字检查无法检测此类攻击。

Method: 通过精心调谐的电磁干扰，诱导CMOS图像传感器产生彩虹色伪影，并分析其对图像信号处理流程和目标检测模型的影响。

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.

### [148] [Adaptive Attention Residual U-Net for curvilinear structure segmentation in fluorescence microscopy and biomedical images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07800)
*Achraf Ait Laydi,Louis Cueff,Mewen Crespo,Yousef El Mourabit,Hélène Bouvrais*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型深度学习架构ASE_Res_UNet，用于在噪声和低对比度条件下分割荧光显微镜中的曲线结构，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光显微镜中曲线结构的分割在噪声和密集网络中具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法在噪声或低对比度条件下性能下降。

Method: 开发了ASE_Res_UNet，结合了残差块和自适应SE注意力机制，通过合成数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: ASE_Res_UNet在噪声和低对比度条件下表现优异，优于其他变体和现有方法，并能泛化到真实图像和其他曲线结构。

Conclusion: ASE_Res_UNet在分割任务中表现出色，具有在疾病诊断和治疗中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion: 该框架在人群分析中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Motivation: 颈动脉斑块的多序列MRI分析对评估动脉粥样硬化和缺血性中风风险至关重要，但数据稀缺和复杂形态增加了准确分割的难度。

Method: 采用两阶段网络：粗定位模型确定感兴趣区域，精细分割模型精确描绘血管壁和斑块；提出多级多序列U-Net架构和半监督学习策略。

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

*Bardia Hejazi,Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用深度学习自动编码器压缩工业X射线计算机断层扫描（XCT）数据的方法，并评估了不同压缩率和架构对数据恢复质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着成像技术的进步，数据量急剧增长，亟需高效可靠的存储解决方案。

Method: 采用两种网络架构（D-CNN和VQ-VAE）对砂岩样本的XCT数据进行压缩，并引入边缘保留敏感指标评估解码质量。

Result: 不同架构和压缩率适用于不同特征保留需求，研究结果为数据存储和分析提供了策略指导。

Conclusion: 研究帮助科学家根据需求选择合适的数据存储和分析策略。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

### [152] [Compressive Imaging Reconstruction via Tensor Decomposed Multi-Resolution Grid Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07707)
*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GridTD是一种无监督连续表示框架，用于压缩成像重建，通过多分辨率哈希网格编码和轻量级神经网络优化，实现高效高维图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督表示方法在表示能力和效率之间难以平衡，GridTD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GridTD结合多分辨率网格编码的层次建模能力和张量分解的紧凑性，优化神经网络和输入张量分解模型。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，GridTD在多种压缩成像任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GridTD是一种高效且先进的压缩成像重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Conclusion: 生成的图像具有高度真实感，有望支持更广泛的临床应用。

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

### [154] [MeD-3D: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Precise Recurrence Prediction in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839)
*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的多模态数据融合框架，用于提高透明细胞肾细胞癌（ccRCC）复发的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预后模型依赖单一数据模态，无法全面捕捉ccRCC的复杂性，导致预测准确性不足。

Method: 整合CT、MRI、组织病理学WSI、临床数据和基因组数据，采用领域特定模型（如CLAM、MeD-3D和MLP）提取特征，并通过早期和晚期融合策略结合多模态信息。

Result: 框架能够处理不完整数据，提升复发预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态数据融合框架为ccRCC的临床决策提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ArteryX是一种基于MATLAB的半自动化工具，用于从3D TOF MRA中高效、准确地量化脑血管特征，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在临床验证中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑血管病变对认知衰退和神经系统疾病有重要影响，但现有评估工具存在用户依赖性、缺乏标准化等问题，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: ArteryX采用基于血管融合网络的标志点方法，结合半监督学习，快速提取血管特征，并整合模拟框架进行验证。

Result: ArteryX在0.5毫米分辨率下每例仅需10-15分钟处理时间，对小血管病变的敏感性优于现有半自动化方法。

Conclusion: ArteryX有望成为临床工作流程中的标准化工具，促进脑血管病理的早期检测和跨队列比较。

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

*Youssef ElTantawy,Alexia Karantana,Xin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用模拟X射线图像训练深度学习模型的方法，用于解决真实X射线图像中腕骨分割的标注数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线图像分割在计算机辅助诊断中至关重要，但高质量标注数据获取困难，尤其是腕骨分割因骨骼重叠而更具挑战性。

Method: 通过从CT体积生成大量模拟X射线图像及其标注，训练深度学习模型，并在模拟和真实X射线图像上评估性能。

Result: 模型在模拟数据集上的Dice分数为0.80至0.92，真实X射线图像的分割结果也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标注数据不足问题，模型和模拟代码将公开供研究使用。

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis
(e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image
segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,
yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior
performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large
amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an
annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of
expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in
X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.
To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of
simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with
their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for
wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated
using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores
ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different
view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray
images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The
trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research
purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像标注数据稀缺、隐私和成本高的问题，模拟医院内部稀疏标注的实际场景。

Method: 使用NIH Chest X-ray14数据集和预训练CLIP模型，通过部分微调视觉编码器，评估零样本和少样本（1-16标注样本/类）学习效果。

Result: 在少样本任务中，平均AUC分数比零样本基线提升超过20%。

Conclusion: 预训练的视觉-语言特征可有效适应少样本医学影像任务，为常见和罕见疾病诊断提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on
large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to
privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a
label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to
reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest
X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via
partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot
and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests
demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively
adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in
mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this
work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image
archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and
scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this
research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not
been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at

Motivation: 解决IDEAL方法在内存使用、运行时间和目标函数匹配性上的不足。

Method: 提出IDEAL-IO，通过交替优化密度估计和光学参数，减少计算负担并提升模型表达能力。

Result: 在多种成像系统中验证，内存和运行时间减少6倍，设计质量提升。

Conclusion: IDEAL-IO为实际成像系统设计提供了一种高效、可扩展的信息论优化策略。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through
the information content of their measurements alone, enabling
application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding
challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed
to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL
across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,
long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to
end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with
Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density
estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting
models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed
models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory
usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide
optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive
optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing
information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for
real-world imaging system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和物联网环境中，计算资源随时间变化，需要动态架构以适应资源限制。现有层丢弃方法在层选择模式或架构修改方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出输入驱动的层丢弃方法，利用输入特征和轻量级层选择网络动态确定最佳处理层组合。

Result: 在4个语音和音频公共基准测试中，使用两种预训练基础模型，验证了方法的有效性，显著优于随机丢弃，性能与提前退出相当或更好。

Conclusion: 输入驱动的层丢弃方法为动态模型提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，适用于资源受限的边缘和物联网环境。

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where
computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures
featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer
dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone
network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows
transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches
exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly
modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven
$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight
layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing
layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks,
using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and
producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.

### [160] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的电影推荐框架，通过结合用户文本偏好与传统推荐算法（SVD/SVD++），显著提升了推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐算法无法基于用户文本偏好提供个性化推荐，而LLM在自然语言处理方面表现出色，因此研究探索如何利用LLM优化推荐系统。

Method: 使用SVD或SVD++算法生成初始推荐，并通过LLM整合用户文本偏好。实验采用MovieLens数据集，通过多种评估指标（如命中率、NDCG）与传统算法对比。

Result: LLM增强的框架在所有评估指标上显著优于传统算法（如累积命中率提升6倍，NDCG提升3.7倍），但计算开销略有增加。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与传统推荐算法能显著提升推荐效果，为个性化推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

TL;DR: ViDove是一种基于多模态输入的翻译代理系统，通过结合视觉和上下文背景信息提升翻译质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译代理仅支持文本输入，无法利用多模态信息，限制了翻译质量。

Method: ViDove采用多模态记忆系统和长短时记忆模块，结合领域知识，提升翻译适应性和准确性。

Result: ViDove在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中BLEU分数提升28%，SubER提升15%，并推出DoveBench基准数据集。

Conclusion: ViDove通过多模态输入显著提升翻译质量，为多模态翻译任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

TL;DR: LangNav是一个专注于语言理解的语义导航数据集，用于测试代理对自然语言指令的细粒度理解能力。LangNavBench是其配套基准，用于系统评估模型在属性、空间关系和类别层次上的表现。提出的MLFM方法在LangNav上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义导航数据集缺乏对语言细粒度理解的测试，LangNav填补了这一空白，旨在评估代理对指令中不同层次语言细节的把握能力。

Method: 提出了LangNav数据集和LangNavBench基准，并开发了Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM)方法，该方法构建可查询的多层语义地图，特别适用于小物体或涉及空间关系的指令。

Result: MLFM在LangNav数据集上优于现有基于地图的导航基线方法。

Conclusion: LangNav和LangNavBench为语言中心的语义导航提供了系统评估工具，MLFM展示了在处理细粒度语言指令上的优势。

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于固定输入嵌入的模块化语言模型扩展方法，支持专家模型的无缝组合和逐层增长，提高了资源效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的扩展方法资源密集且缺乏灵活性，作者探索了一种基于固定嵌入的替代方案，以实现更高效的模型开发和扩展。

Method: 1. 使用固定嵌入作为通用接口，支持专家模型的组合（通过平均输出logits）；2. 逐层增长训练方法，逐步堆叠和训练Transformer层。

Result: 组合后的专家模型在MMLU等基准测试中表现优于单一模型；逐层训练方法稳定收敛，且模型深度与复杂推理能力正相关。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种更生物化或构造性的AI开发范式，支持模块化组合和增量扩展，为高效扩展和持续学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: LLM在不同输入下表现不一致，现有研究多关注单模型，忽略了模型多样性对不确定性量化的潜在价值。

Method: 提出MUSE方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度选择和集成校准良好的LLM子集。

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE在校准和预测性能上优于单模型和简单集成基线。

Conclusion: 模型多样性可提升LLM不确定性估计的可靠性，MUSE为高风险场景提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合训练单目标和多目标奖励模型的框架，以解决RLHF中的奖励破解问题，并在OOD场景中显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和评分性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法在分布外（OOD）场景中表现不佳，且多目标奖励模型因数据质量有限而性能较弱。

Method: 提出联合训练Bradley-Terry单目标和多目标回归奖励模型的框架，共享嵌入空间，理论分析其互补性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能，7B模型超越70B基线。

Conclusion: 联合训练框架有效解决了奖励破解问题，提升了OOD场景下的性能。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖显式Gram矩阵计算和逆运算导致数值不稳定，影响近似质量。

Method: 采用无逆正则化框架，基于稳定分解，解决了内存不足、矩阵接近奇异和数据不足等问题。

Result: 方法在多种挑战性场景下表现稳定，并证明了收敛性和误差界限。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了近似质量，克服了现有技术的数值缺陷。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Motivation: 由于不同公司和国家对职业的定义存在差异，需要一种方法将O*NET数据库中的职业与其他定义进行映射。

Method: 使用多种BERT技术和聚类方法构建管道，并研究降维对聚类性能的影响。

Result: 通过专用轮廓方法改进了聚类结果，为职业自动区分提供了新途径。

Conclusion: 该方法为职业映射和职业转换提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）的越狱攻击漏洞具有挑战性，现有方法存在不足。

Method: 引入GuardVal协议，动态生成和优化越狱提示，结合新优化方法防止停滞。

Result: 应用于多种模型（如Mistral-7b、GPT-4），揭示其行为模式和漏洞。

Conclusion: GuardVal提供了更准确的漏洞评估，为未来研究及模型安全开发提供见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Result: 在11个识别数据集上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过消除描述提取过程，显著提升了提示的语义丰富性和可靠性，同时展示了多提示加权的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT的自注意力机制能有效处理噪声、避免过平滑，并捕捉长程依赖，时空注意力块的分离设计提升了模型的全面性和有效性。

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Motivation: 多任务学习中不同任务的目标差异可能导致负迁移，现有方法因固定网络容量和结构限制适应性，动态网络架构效率低。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，在令牌空间中识别梯度冲突并自适应解决，避免直接转换共享参数为任务特定参数。

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL显著提升多任务性能，计算开销小，适应性强。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的多任务学习提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Method: 1) 全局视角数据回放模块以隐私保护方式重构先前任务的全局表示，指导类感知和重要性敏感采样；2) 任务感知温度缩放模块根据任务动态调整logits温度，减少对多数类的过自信。

Result: 在异构数据分布下实现平衡的类采样，任务不平衡时泛化能力提升，Top-1准确率比六种先进方法提高2%-15%。

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过全局协调和动态调整机制有效解决了类不平衡问题，显著提升了联邦类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TRIX是一种特征感知的对抗训练框架，通过自适应分配不同强度的对抗样本，减少类别间鲁棒性差异，提升最差类别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法对所有类别采用统一目标，忽略了类别间脆弱性差异，导致对抗不公平性。强类别更鲁棒，弱类别更易受攻击。

Method: TRIX为强类别分配较弱的针对性对抗样本，为弱类别分配更强的非针对性对抗样本，并结合每类损失权重和扰动强度调整。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，TRIX显著提升了最差类别准确率，减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，同时保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是实现公平有效对抗防御的实用方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Motivation: 解决传统测试时训练（TTT）在多任务场景中因任务行为不同步而导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出S4T方法，通过预测跨域任务关系来同步多任务行为，结合传统TTT协议。

Result: S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T有效解决了多任务场景下的域适应问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.
