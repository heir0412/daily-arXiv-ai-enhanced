### [1] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多语言预训练模型中的社会偏见研究进行了系统性综述，分析了偏见评估和缓解方法在多语言和非英语语境中的应用现状、挑战和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多语言模型表现出与英语文本处理模型相同的社会偏见，但现有研究在语言多样性、文化意识和评估方法方面存在局限性，需要系统梳理和指导未来研究方向。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析多语言偏见评估和缓解技术的研究现状，重点关注语言多样性、文化适应性、评估指标选择和技术应用等方面。

Result: 研究发现该领域存在方法学设计选择上的差距（如偏好某些语言、多语言缓解实验稀缺），同时记录了跨语言和文化适应偏见基准的常见问题和解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了未来研究的方向，以增强多语言偏见文献的包容性、跨文化适当性以及与最先进NLP进展的一致性。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用语言模型自动生成形态评估选择题，通过结构化提示策略和微调中等模型，显著提升了生成质量，为K-12语言评估提供了实用且可扩展的工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，探索语言模型在自动生成选择题方面的应用潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5 175B)；评估七种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、顺序设计等组合。使用自动化指标和专家评分进行项目评估，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略（特别是思维链与顺序设计组合）显著提升了Gemma的输出质量。Gemma生成的题目比GPT-3.5的零样本响应更符合构念对齐和教学适宜性，提示设计在中等模型性能中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可以在有限数据条件下增强中等模型的自动生成能力。结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法能确保与评估目标的一致性，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

### [3] [Integrating SystemC TLM into FMI 3.0 Co-Simulations with an Open-Source Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20223)
*Andrei Mihai Albu,Giovanni Pollo,Alessio Burrello,Daniele Jahier Pagliari,Cristian Tesconi,Alessandra Neri,Dario Soldi,Fabio Autieri,Sara Vinco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将SystemC TLM模型集成到FMI协同仿真工作流的开源方法，通过将SystemC组件封装为FMI 3.0 FMU实现跨域集成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息物理系统复杂度的增加，特别是汽车应用中，需要高效的建模和跨域协同仿真技术。SystemC TLM虽然支持硬件/软件协同设计，但与其他工程领域模型的互操作性有限

Method: 通过将SystemC TLM组件封装为FMI 3.0协同仿真功能模型单元(FMU)，开发轻量级开源工具链，解决时间同步和数据交换等关键技术挑战

Result: 通过代表性案例研究证明了该集成方法的可行性和有效性

Conclusion: 该方法实现了SystemC TLM模型与FMI标准协同仿真的无缝集成，为异构仿真环境提供了标准化解决方案

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决了小型语言模型在强化学习训练中奖励稀疏和不稳定的问题，使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习训练中面临奖励稀疏和不稳定的问题，难以实现代理式RAG行为。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现代理式RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一个将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的方法，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并整合越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其生成有害内容的风险引发社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南缺乏具体可操作的测试方法，需要将高层次要求转化为实际测试问题。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动生成违反政府指南的问题来测试LLM响应合规性。对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD进行越狱诊断，创建可能绕过安全机制的测试场景。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna、Llama系列、GPT系列和Claude）上验证了有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性，并能将越狱诊断扩展到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来评估LLM对伦理指南的遵守程度，有助于促进可靠LLM应用的发展，并能识别潜在的安全绕过风险。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个通过图推理增强大语言模型长文本理解能力的新框架，包含摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个核心组件，在多个评估指标上优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长上下文处理中的内存限制、复杂任务处理能力不足、缺乏透明性和容易产生幻觉的问题

Method: 集成三个关键组件：策略性文本分块提取摘要、构建有向无环图消除冗余、使用蒙特卡洛树搜索进行复杂推理路径导航

Result: 在ROUGE和F1指标上持续优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖解决方案，显著提升了可靠性和透明度

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，通过两阶段调优框架提升LLM的长思维链推理能力，Graph-R1-7B模型在多个领域表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长思维链推理能力的发展依赖于成本高、人工精选的训练数据集，需要找到一种可扩展的替代方案

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，构建两阶段调优框架：1）基于拒绝采样的长思维链有监督学习；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习

Result: Graph-R1-7B模型在数学、编码、STEM和逻辑领域都表现出强大的泛化能力，在NP难图论问题上的准确性和推理效率都超过QwQ-32B模型

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种有效且可扩展的资源，可以推动LLM长思维链推理能力的发展，为LLM调优开启了新方向

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知人格评估框架CAPE，通过分析对话历史对LLM响应一致性和人格特质的影响，发现上下文能增强一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试对LLM采用无上下文方法，忽略了真实对话中历史交互对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验，分析对话历史对响应一致性和人格特质的影响。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但会导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，而Gemini和Llama对上下文敏感；角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高一致性并与人类判断更好对齐。

Conclusion: 上下文在LLM人格评估中至关重要，CAPE框架能更准确地评估LLM行为特质，为理解LLM在真实对话场景中的表现提供了新视角。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵值递减对应正确答案，熵值平坦或递增则往往错误。错误推理路径通常更长，表明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨推理步骤对最终答案正确性的实际贡献。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文不能保证提高答案置信度，需要预测推理步骤的效用性。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确率的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤对答案Y的不确定性。

Result: 条件熵随步骤递减的模式与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，说明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道提供了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含36,597个问题和3.37亿token的语料库，用于评估和提升LLM在牙科专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用医学基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专业医学领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性的评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（英中问答基准）和DentalCorpus（大规模高质量牙科语料库），评估14个LLM并测试领域适应效果。

Result: 发现不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距，领域适应显著提升模型性能，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，牙科领域适应能显著改善模型表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

*Chi Minh Bui,Ngoc Mai Thieu,Van Vinh Nguyen,Json J. Jung,Khac-Hoai Nam Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个新颖的知识图谱增强检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询上下文，在RAG系统中显著提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂输入查询的上下文表示增强。知识图谱与LLMs的结合具有提升RAG系统检索阶段的潜力

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块。通过语料中心知识图谱的结构化关系表示来丰富查询上下文，作为模型无关的管道实现

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上表现优异，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性RAG任务中检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱增强的查询上下文表示，有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

*Feng Zhang,Chengjie Pang,Yuehan Zhang,Chenyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 创建了一个专门用于民航维修领域的工业级评测标准，用于评估大语言模型在该领域的知识和复杂思维能力，并支持RAG系统的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型评测主要集中在数学和编码思维任务，缺乏专门用于民航维修这种知识密集垂直领域的评估工具。民航维修需要复杂的知识维护和故障排除思维能力。

Method: 开发了一个工业级标准测试集，用于评估LLM在民航维修场景下的知识和思维能力。还使用该标准测试环境对现有知名的矩阵嵌入模型和LLM进行评测。

Result: 通过实验探索和分析，证明了该标准在评估模型在民航维修领域表现方面的有效性。工作已开源以促进更进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了当前LLM评测在垂直行业领域的空白，为民航维修领域提供了专业的评测标准，有助于指导领域特定的模型优化和RAG系统的改进。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

TL;DR: 基于案例推理(CBR)和TF-IDF技术的实践工作标题搜索系统，通过余弦相似度计算匹配度，在705个标题测试中表现良好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决实践工作标题搜索问题，利用历史案例经验来寻找最相似的工作标题，提高搜索效率和准确性

Method: 使用案例推理(CBR)方法，结合TF-IDF进行文本向量化处理，采用余弦相似度计算标题间的相似性匹配值

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，系统在两个测试阶段都表现良好，第二阶段获得了相同数量的匹配标题和更高的平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，无论是完整标题还是关键词搜索都能获得准确的匹配结果，证明了CBR和TF-IDF方法在文本相似性搜索中的有效性

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench是一个基于Model Context Protocol的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在多步骤工具使用、跨工具协调和复杂规划推理方面的能力，包含28个真实MCP服务器和250个工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的API基准测试主要依赖显式工具规范、浅层工作流程和孤立领域操作，无法充分评估LLM在模糊指令下检索工具、规划多跳执行轨迹、协调跨领域工作流等关键能力。

Method: 基于MCP协议构建基准，连接28个真实MCP服务器，涵盖金融、旅行、科学计算和学术搜索等领域，设计多步骤任务测试工具理解、规划执行和任务完成能力。

Result: 对20个先进LLM的实验显示，在MCP-Bench上仍存在持续挑战，表明当前模型在复杂工具使用和跨域协调方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench提供了一个更真实、全面的评估框架，能够更好地测试LLM在实际工具使用场景中的综合能力，填补了现有基准测试的不足。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个深度学习框架，通过整合多模态电子健康记录（结构化数据和自由文本）来预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，在多个临床任务上显著优于现有方法，并展现出对数据损坏的强大鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本中的宝贵临床信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态EHR的深度学习方法来优化ICU患者预后和成本管理。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，整合多模态EHR数据。通过消融研究评估三个关键组件：医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器，并测试模型对结构化EHR数据损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的三个临床任务中，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE改善0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%。在不同损坏率下均表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，证明了使用提示学习和transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的成功。模型对结构化数据损坏具有强大韧性，特别是在高损坏水平下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

TL;DR: 提出了ConspirED数据集，用于分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成虚假信息日益复杂，理解阴谋论修辞模式对制定干预措施和评估AI漏洞很重要

Method: 引入ConspirED数据集，使用CONSPIR认知框架标注在线阴谋文章的多句子摘录，开发计算模型识别阴谋特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性

Result: 发现大语言模型会被阴谋论内容误导，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使能够成功抵制类似的事实核查虚假信息

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的干预措施来提高AI系统对阴谋论内容的抵抗力

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、源文本领域特定和文化偏见、命名实体简单复制可获得高BLEU分数等问题，需要更领域通用和文化中立的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在翻译质量、文化偏见和评估协议方面存在严重缺陷，需要更准确的评估标准。

Method: 通过人工评估四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析源文本的领域特定性和文化偏见，并测试简单启发式方法对BLEU分数的影响。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于90%标准，源文本过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单复制命名实体可获得非平凡BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关测试集上表现好。

Conclusion: 需要构建使用领域通用、文化中立源文本且减少命名实体依赖的多语言MT基准，以更好地反映真实世界翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和LLM指导的对比学习，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越表现为此提供了新的解决方案。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容；2) 集成基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务的空间优化模块；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，优化三元组对比损失；4) 在三个真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的强大文本理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献分析提供了更准确和高效的主题识别解决方案。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Motivation: 现实环境中本地客户端数据高度异构，现有联邦蒸馏方法主要关注标签(output)多样性，而忽略了语言领域(input)多样性这一NLP中的关键因素。

Method: 提出了自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架，包含多领域非IID场景的统一基准测试框架，支持同构和异构设置下的多领域非IID挑战处理。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习在真实环境中的评估提供了更全面的基准，AdaFD框架在多领域非IID场景下表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，导致语言模型容易学习伪模式。现有方法侧重于简单问题生成，但忽略了必要知识的整合。

Method: 将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关知识，在推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问题生成的多样性和质量，为多跳问答任务提供了更好的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Method: 提出CLEGR评测基准，通过合成图生成流程配合需要结构和语义联合推理的问题，在不同复杂度层面评估多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Result: 在英语中RoBERTa-HArch表现最佳，多语言情况下XLM-RoBERTa-HArch最优；细调模型在所有语言配置下都较GPT-4o和Llama-4-Maverick更好；在DiscoGeM 1.0语料库上达到当前最佳结果

Conclusion: 任务特定的细调模型在隐式话语关系识别中优于提示学习的大语言模型，层次方法有效提升了性能

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型中的标记化不一致性问题，提出了针对文本隐写和水印技术的两种解决方案，显著提高了文本质量和系统稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在提升文本生成质量的同时，也带来了文本隐写和水印技术中的标记化不一致性问题，这种不一致性会影响系统的稳健性。

Method: 识别出导致标记化不一致的问题标记具有频率低和临时性两大特征，并针对文本隐写和水印技术分别提出了步进验证方法和后处理回滚方法。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)在文本隐写中，直接解决标记化不一致问题能够提高文本流畅性、难以察觉性和反隐写分析能力；(2)在水印技术中，解决标记化不一致问题能够提高检测能力和对攻击的稳健性。

Conclusion: 通过针对性地解决标记化不一致问题，可以有效提升大语言模型在文本隐写和水印技术中的性能表现，为防止恶意使用提供更有效的保护措施。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)，仅用510步RL训练和64个GPU在一周内完成训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长链思维(CoT)方法在复杂问题解决中存在局限性，需要开发能够自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的智能体模型，同时降低训练成本和计算资源需求

Method: 采用智能体强化学习框架，包含三个关键创新：(1)高效的RL基础设施和可靠的Python代码执行环境；(2)GRPO-RoC算法处理编码工具的环境噪声；(3)从非推理SFT开始的多阶段RL训练方法

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)，响应更短，同时在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了小模型通过智能体强化学习可以实现前沿性能，为高效智能体训练提供了可行的技术路径，在数学推理和其他认知任务中具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下进行邻域感知的文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理，在较低ε值下实现隐私保护与文本连贯性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要寻找在保持合理隐私保护水平的同时提高文本质量的方法。

Method: 使用语义三元组进行分治处理，限制隐私保护邻域范围，并结合大型语言模型进行后处理生成连贯文本。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯的文本，实现了隐私保护与实用性的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 文本连贯性对于在合理隐私保护水平下获得平衡的隐私化输出至关重要，分治策略结合LLM后处理是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

TL;DR: 通过细调基于LLM的通用嵌入模型，在隐式恨恼语言检测中实现了独立的独立新的最高性能，无需额外知识或上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式恨恼语言(IHS)通过隐蕴符号、讽刺或编码术语传递偏见和恨意，因不包含显式辱称性词汇而难以检测。传统方法需要依赖外部知识或额外信息。

Method: 简单细调最新的通用嵌入模型（Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed、E5），不使用任何额外知识或上下文信息。

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上实现了独立的最高性能：内部数据集评估F1-macro提升1.10%，跨数据集评估提升达20.35%。

Conclusion: 简单的细调通用嵌入模型方法可以有效检测隐式恨恼语言，无需复杂的外部知识补充，显示了LLM基础模型的强大能力。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时提高生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，加入基于token数量的惩罚机制降低计算开销

Result: 实验结果显示GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成的心理治疗对话虽然在流畅性和结构连贯性上表现良好，但在情感动态方面与真实对话存在显著差异，真实对话具有更大的情感变异性、更丰富的情感语言和更真实的反应调节模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的心理治疗对话在心理健康NLP中广泛应用，需要评估这些合成对话是否能够捕捉真实治疗中微妙的情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析真实和LLM生成的认知行为治疗对话在效价、唤醒度和支配度三个维度上的细粒度情感轨迹，比较完整对话和个体说话者角色。

Result: 合成对话与真实对话在关键情感属性上存在差异：真实会话表现出更大的情感变异性、更多情感丰富的语言以及更真实的反应和调节模式。真实和合成说话者之间的情感弧相似度较低，尤其是客户角色。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在局限性，情感保真度在心理健康应用中至关重要。研究引入了RealCBT数据集来支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型激活转向拒绝介导子空间来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调即可提高安全拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全对齐的方法。

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，通过对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，从小规模有害/无害指令对计算安全方向。

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等标准基准上保持模型实用性，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全性的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

TL;DR: 提出了GDLLM方法，基于大语言模型(LLMs)的全局距离感知建模方法，通过图注意力网络和软推理时序特征学习，有效解决事件时序关系抽取中的长距离依赖和少数类关系识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)在类别不平衡数据集上处理少数类关系能力有限，而大语言模型(LLMs)使用手动设计的提示可能引入噪声，干扰对事件间长距离依赖关系的判断。

Method: 提出GDLLM框架：1)使用图注意力网络(GAT)构建距离感知图结构辅助LLMs捕获长距离依赖特征；2)基于软推理的时序特征学习范式，将LLMs生成的概率信息补充到多头注意力机制中，增强短距离邻近带的关系识别。

Result: 在TB-Dense和MATRES两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在少数关系类别的性能显著提升，整体学习能力改善，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，能够显著增强少数关系类别的性能，并提高整体学习能力，为事件时序关系抽取任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强系统通常在单源或短答案场景下评估，但现实应用需要整合分散在多源中的信息并生成综合回答。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的框架来构建评估基准，创建了两个多源检索与合成的基准：MSRS-Story（叙事合成）和MSRS-Meet（摘要任务），使用稀疏和密集检索器结合前沿LLM进行实验。

Result: 生成质量高度依赖于检索效果，不同任务间差异很大；即使在理想检索设置下，多源合成仍然具有挑战性；推理模型在合成步骤上显著优于标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息整合是RAG系统的重要挑战，需要改进检索和生成组件的能力，特别是推理模型在信息合成方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其对多语言任务（特别是机器翻译）的影响尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估量化对不同语言和模型规模的影响

Method: 使用5个参数量从17亿到700亿的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较了4种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound），并分析了量化与解码超参数、校准语言的交互作用

Result: 4位量化通常能保持高资源语言和大模型的翻译质量，但对低资源和类型多样语言在2位设置下出现显著质量下降；GGUF变体在2位精度下提供最一致的性能；语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景下有益

Conclusion: 研究为在量化约束下部署多语言大语言模型进行机器翻译提供了实用见解，特别是在低资源设置中，算法选择和模型大小共同决定了量化鲁棒性

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 当前语音到语音大语言模型的评估存在根本性挑战，传统级联方法忽视声学特征，且缺乏可解释性和语音偏好数据稀缺。

Method: 提出SageLM模型，联合评估语义和声学维度；采用理性监督增强可解释性；构建SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集；使用两阶段训练范式缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: SageLM与人类评估者的一致率达到82.79%，分别比级联方法和SLM基线方法高出至少7.42%和26.20%。

Conclusion: SageLM为S2S大语言模型提供了全面、可解释的评估框架，在语义和声学维度上都表现出色，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出更高的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM在多轮工具调用对话中的挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段示例选择策略，通过结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，并添加可插拔模块增强语法信息，显著提升语义解析等结构化预测任务的上下文学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL选择策略在结构化预测任务中往往忽视结构对齐，导致性能不佳和泛化能力差。需要一种既能保持语义相关性又能实现结构对齐的示例选择方法。

Method: 两阶段策略：1) 使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器；2) 添加模型无关的可插拔模块，增强隐藏表示中的语法有意义信息。该方法高效、通用且易于集成。

Result: 在涵盖三个语义解析任务的四个基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有基线，与多个最新LLM作为推理时模型配合使用效果显著。

Conclusion: 所提出的结构感知示例选择策略在效率、泛化性和性能之间实现了良好平衡，为结构化预测任务的上下文学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导两个维度，建立跨领域评估指标，并开发自动生成多样化评估数据的方法。构建了6个领域共328个评估环境。

Result: 实验测试了22种不同类型的大语言模型，发现DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，讨论了这些发现对未来模型开发的启示，为全面评估LLM主动对话能力提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除LLM后门行为的新方法，结合内部模型融合和外部提示注入机制，在多个LLM上显著降低后门攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法全面应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案

Method: 内部机制：使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型融合，稀释后门影响；外部机制：在提示中添加良性相关证据，分散LLM对后门特征的注意力

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务中，LETHE优于8个SOTA防御基线，对高级后门攻击的攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用

Conclusion: LETHE是一种成本效益高、鲁棒性强的后门防御方法，能有效应对自适应后门攻击，为LLM安全提供了全面解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能，但发现在大型数据集Wikidata上性能较差，主要原因是标签噪声和表征重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，传统方法在处理复杂关系时存在局限性，需要探索更有效的表征学习方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过动态路由来学习更好的关系表征。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上超越现有最佳方法，但在Wikidata数据集上性能较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，表征重表示能力是句子关系抽取的一个重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面表现优于基线模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂推理和精确计算，传统方法耗时且易出错，而纯语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性

Method: 将LLMs与符号求解器集成，将文本规则转换为形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的案例表示范例

Result: 系统在SARA数据集上表现优异，部署成本显著低于现实世界平均税务申报成本

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望提供可靠、经济可行的税务援助，促进公平获取税务服务

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在多模态任务中常见的幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的回答

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉和非幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)策略对现有MLLMs进行对齐微调

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: 基于CHAIR的奖励机制通过DPO对齐训练能有效减少MLLMs的幻觉现象，且无需复杂流程或依赖专有模型

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Motivation: 现有图片伪造定位方法依赖人工注释数据，成本高且难以跟上新兴多模态大模型带来的图片编辑技术挑战。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将高速滤波器提取的图片伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，在保留输入图片丰富语义信息的同时增强伪造定位性能。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升了12%的性能，对训练未见的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像也表现出强劲的防伪性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将SD的图像生成和知觉能力集成到图像防伪中，为应对新兴多模态图像编辑技术的挑战提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Motivation: AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面已显示出显著成功，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能在实际临床中使用。多模态大语言模型提供了通过自然语言推理增加可解释性的潜力，而定量属性（如病变面积）已被证明能高精度预测恶性程度。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过将预测基于可解释的概念来实现更好的临床实用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的漂移和失真问题，为高质量长时长人体动画生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的全景视频显著性预测数据集，以及需要处理球面扭曲和结合空间音频的复杂性，研究者创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集并开发新模型。

Method: 研究创建了81个全景视频的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，并提出两种模型：SalViT360（基于Vision Transformer的球面几何感知注意力机制）和SalViT360-AV（在前者基础上增加音频条件化的Transformer适配器）。

Conclusion: 研究证明了结合视觉和空间音频线索对全景视频显著性预测的重要性，提出的SalViT360模型为该领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一种新的混合视觉-语言表征框架，通过结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型，实现了微观结构数据与专家评估的连接，支持零样本分类和可解释性的材料质量评估。


<details>

Conclusion: 该方法提高了质量评估流程的可追溯性和可解释性，支持人在循环决策而无需任务特定模型重新训练。通过提进原始数据与专家知识的语义互操性，为工程信息学中的可扩展和领域适配性质量评估策略做出了贡献。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化轮空间分割方法，在T2杀强MRI数据上达到了预期的性能，但在异质性T1杀强数据上表现不如nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轮空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有的深度学习模型性能中等且稿性一般化能力有限，需要更有效的自动化分割方法。

Method: 适配MedNeXt-L-k5（Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络）进行轮空间分割，训练了两个模型：一个使用均质的HCP-Aging T2杀强数据，另一个使用异质性的T1杀强数据，并使用5折交叉验证和留一个地点交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 在T2杀强数据上达到白质Dice分数0.88±0.06，与手动分割可靠性相当，为文献中最高水平；在T1杀强数据上Dice分数为0.58±0.09；在异质性数据上的分割性能不如nnU-Net。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的轮空间自动分割方案，但Transformer模型的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割高准确性的必需条件，nnU-Net在异质性数据上仍有更优表现。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的自适应反馈框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 提出训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，将基于输出的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力。设计关键模块包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成，有效反馈输出一致性线索。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法和三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）中，在多种注意力类型和八个基准测试中一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，该方法增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，有效解决了CLIP在开放词汇分割中的定位问题。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制尚未得到充分探索，需要系统性的分析框架来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL中发现一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉接地，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了分析MLLMs层间组织的统一视角，为理解多模态表示动态提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了SLiCS方法，通过线性综合模型将视觉-语言嵌入空间解构为特定概念的子空间，实现了更精确的概念筛选图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入空间包含了丰富的语义信息，但需要将其解构以分离复杂场景的内容信息，从而提高下游任务的精确性。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，通过新题交替优化算法估计线性综合模型，将嵌入分解为特定概念的组合向量，每个概念组件是相关标签原子的非负组合。

Result: 在TiTok自动编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上都实现了更精确的概念筛选图像检索，定量和定性结果都显示了性能提升。

Conclusion: SLiCS方法通过线性解构嵌入空间，为概念级别的图像检索和条件生成提供了更精确的控制能力，在多种嵌入空间上都取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中具有巨大潜力，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，包括受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生手动选择和使用不同模型，工程师可快速部署开源模型，通过Docker编排实现隐私保护的推理，仅需本地工作站和单个NVIDIA A6000 GPU。

Result: 通过聘请认证病理学家评估5个最先进的VLM模型（Google-MedGemma3-4B等），在结肠和肾脏病例上进行1015次临床医生-模型评分，发现模型存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和不一致的病理学术语等重复性限制。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前最先进的医疗VLM模型仍存在显著的技术局限性，需要在临床应用中谨慎使用并持续改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题。现有方法往往需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间做出妥协。

Method: 采用BIM架构，包含BI-Scan机制（构建任务特定的双向序列表示，集成任务优先和位置优先扫描模式）和MS-Scan机制（实现多粒度场景建模）。

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出色，优于最先进的竞争方法。

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务交互。

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 综合实验证明该框架能够在复杂编辑场景中优称表现，通过融合音频的丰富信息来完成仅依靠文本方法无法完成的任务。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂多模态视觉编辑任务提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案，显著提升了音频在视觉编辑中的应用价值。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML中的噪声和标注不足问题，为多标签学习提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our

TL;DR: 提出MSMVD方法，通过多尺度BEV特征投影和特征金字塔网络处理，解决多视角行人检测中尺度变化大的问题，在GMVD数据集上MODA提升4.5分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端深度学习方法在多视角行人检测中难以处理视角内尺度一致偏小/偏大以及视角间尺度差异大的行人检测问题，因为它们没有充分利用多尺度图像特征

Method: MSMVD方法：1）从各视角提取多尺度图像特征，逐尺度投影到BEV空间生成多尺度BEV特征；2）使用特征金字塔网络处理多尺度BEV特征，融合多视角不同尺度信息

Result: 实验证明利用多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征能显著提升检测性能，在GMVD数据集上MODA指标比之前最佳方法提高4.5分

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征生成和处理能有效解决多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，MSMVD方法在性能上取得显著提升

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级实时深度伪造检测网络SFMFNet，通过空间-频率混合感知模块和多尺度特征融合，在保持高精度的同时实现实时检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器计算成本高，难以在视频会议和社交媒体等实时应用场景中部署，需要轻量高效的检测方案。

Method: 设计空间-频率混合感知模块（联合利用空间纹理和频率伪影）、令牌选择性交叉注意力机制（高效多级特征交互）和残差增强模糊池化结构（保留关键语义线索）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实验表明，SFMFNet在准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡，具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了一种轻量有效的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗环境中计算资源有限，部署大规模模型存在困难，需要开发既轻量又能保持高性能的模型

Method: 使用双模型权重选择策略从大型预训练模型初始化两个轻量模型，然后应用自知识蒸馏进行知识迁移，最后针对目标任务进行微调

Result: 在胸部X光、肺部CT和脑部MRI等多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更优的性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 结合双模型权重选择和自知识蒸馏的方法能够有效克服传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于LiDAR点云压缩的高效预测编码框架，通过几何重稠密化和跨尺度特征传播模块实现紧凑特征表示，在KITTI数据集上达到最先进的压缩比和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将无序点云转换为层次化的八叉树或体素结构进行预测编码，但几何细节的极端稀疏性阻碍了高效的上下文建模，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 框架包含两个轻量级模块：1) 几何重稠密化模块 - 重新稠密化编码的稀疏几何，在更密集尺度提取特征，然后重新稀疏化用于预测编码；2) 跨尺度特征传播模块 - 利用多分辨率级别的占用线索指导层次特征传播，实现跨尺度信息共享。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，编码和解码均达到26 FPS的实时性能（12位量化）。

Conclusion: 通过集成两个模块，该方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程，在保持轻量级预测头的同时避免了高稀疏细节上的昂贵计算。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本和图像，互联网上的3D数据量有限。视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性先验和语义信息，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D生成中的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建Droplet3D-4M大规模多视角标注视频数据集，训练Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性和语义先验进行3D生成。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，所有资源包括数据集、代码、技术框架和模型权重均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Conclusion: G^2Editor提供了一个统一的框架，能够生成逼真且精确的物体编辑结果，同时有利于下游数据驱动任务

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Motivation: 胎儿脑分割对于评估神经发育至关重要，但胱体胶体发育不良(CCD)等稀有病变导致注释数据极其稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的推广能力

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD病变的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅使用健康数据就能模拟多样化的脑部改变

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD病例和47例其他脑部病理的期前样本中，方法在CCD病例上取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病理的性能。胱体胶体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可以有效减轻数据稀缺问题，提高对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别探索了唇部运动作为非手动线索在手语理解中的协同作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等任务上达到或优于专门的最先进模型，且显式建模唇部运动显著提升了手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 多模态统一框架具有显著优势，唇部运动作为独立模态的显式建模对手语理解至关重要，为无障碍通信技术提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮推理和门控双级奖励系统，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，无需外部视觉语言模型即可实现端到端训练，推动了长视频理解技术的发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Result: 在多种数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化双重不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在误差累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据特征解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性，并通过自适应阈值和置信度评分进行加权自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和一致性约束，以及置信度感知的样本学习策略，有效解决了持续测试时适应中的伪标签噪声和误差累积问题。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用3DGS模型通过回传频色损失来细调相机标定参数，提升新视角合成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而现有方法缺乏真实场景的真实标准

Method: 利用3DGS模型，通过回传新视角频色损失来对相机参数进行细调优化

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升了0.4 dB PSNR，显著改善了新视角合成质量

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时，但对于重要场景的标定（如Mip-NeRF 360），新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低医学图像标注成本，通过智能样本选择实现高性能分割，为多模态医学数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决传统方法仅在标签级利用RGB图像和LiDAR数据的问题，这种方法忽视了两种数据源在补充性上的潜力，导致伪标签质量提升有限

Method: 提出数据级融合框架，利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，通过双向融合把2D类别标签传递给3D点云，并将2D像素投影到3D提高点密度，使用局部和全局筛波消除噪声，采用动态自成长策略迭代精细伪标签

Conclusion: 数据级融合方案能够更好地利用RGB图像和LiDAR数据的补充性，通过双向融合和迭代精细机制，有效提升了无监督3D目标检测的性能

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解域适应技术，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有优异性能和实用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失加权策略，训练初期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现CNN模型的SOTA性能，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法简单有效，通过对比学习和动态加权策略显著提升视频目标检测性能，且不增加推理时的计算负担

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的行为并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，并通过选择性切除这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Motivation: 半导体制造中MFI数据集因专有性问题稀缺，限制了机器学习模型训练，需要生成合成数据来优化缺陷定位

Method: 基于扩散模型，集成两个物理约束条件，生成功率短路等常见缺陷类型的合成MFI图像

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能有效生成高质量的合成MFI数据，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，优化半导体缺陷定位流程

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Method: 设计了GAN基础的攻击框架，采用进阶性特征优化(PFO)技术，将生成器分解为层次块并逐步精炼中间表征。使用L1-ball约束来稳定优化过程和提高图像真实性。

Result: 在广泛实验中表现显著超过现有攻击方法，在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及面对更深更复杂的DNN模型时都显示出优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有数据重构攻击在深层模型上的局限性，显著提升了重构质量和通用性，对分布式学习安全构成了更大的威胁。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Method: 提出扩散模型框架EmoCAST，包含文本引导的解耦情感模块增强空间知识，情感音频注意力模块捕捉情感与音频的交互，并构建情感数据集配合情感感知采样和渐进功能训练策略。

Result: EmoCAST在生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，成功解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个新颖的即插即用框架，通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域来解决3D高斯头像重建中后脑区域质量差的问题，显著提升了完整头像的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：主题特定生成器（SSG）从稀疏正面输入生成身份一致的后视图伪图像；自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack在保持正面保真度的同时，显著提升了后脑重建质量，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack有效解决了3D高斯头像重建中后脑区域质量差的问题，为构建完整一致的高质量3D头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Motivation: 历史绘画中的人物识别对艺术史研究很重要，但传统人脸识别模型在绘画领域表现不佳，主要由于领域偏移、风格变化和艺术因素等挑战。

Method: 通过微调基础模型，并将其嵌入特征与传统人脸识别网络的嵌入特征进行融合，构建了一个改进的艺术品人脸识别系统。

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在抽象高对比度的涂鸦风格中，面部细微变形导致身份识别性丧失的问题，保持个人和文化真实性。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 在面部特征一致性方面表现优异，获得最先进的美学和人类偏好评分，在Cruilla Festival现场部署展示了实际创作影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作，为创造性AI应用中平衡风格自由度和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种可扩展、成本效益高的自主对齐方法，为解决大型多模态模型的对齐挑战提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Method: 构建S-HArM多模态数据集（9,576个社交媒体图像-文本对），探索三种提示策略生成合成训练数据，比较多种多模态融合方法、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 基于图像和多模态引导的合成数据训练的模型在真实内容上泛化能力更好（因为保留了视觉上下文），但整体性能仍然有限。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Conclusion: 提出的改进训练方法有效提升了移动端图像-文本模型的性能，同时发布了预训练模型和可扩展的数据生成代码

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary

Conclusion: 该方法实现了码率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种码率和码率受限应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心脏运动估计方法依赖基于图像强度的配准相似性损失，往往忽略心脏解剖区域，导致运动估计不准确。需要一种能够专注于解剖区域的方法来提高心脏运动估计的准确性。

Method: 提出CardioMorphNet，一种循环贝叶斯深度学习框架，使用变分自编码器建模心脏周期的时空依赖性，通过两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计，采用从贝叶斯公式推导的损失函数递归配准分割图。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面表现出优越性能，优于最先进方法，并且能够计算运动场的不确定性图，在心脏区域产生更低的不确定性值。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的配准方法和贝叶斯建模，能够更准确地估计心脏运动，并提供更高置信度的预测，为心脏功能评估提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

*Yibin Wang,Zhimin Li,Yuhang Zang,Yujie Zhou,Jiazi Bu,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Cheng Jin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Pref-GRPO方法来解决基于点式奖励模型的奖励攻击问题，通过成对偏好比较实现更稳定的训练，并建立了UniGenBench基准测试来全面评估文本到图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的文本到图像生成方法容易受到奖励攻击，即模型过度优化微小分数差异导致生成过程不稳定。同时现有基准测试评估标准粗糙，无法全面评估模型性能。

Method: 提出Pref-GRPO方法，使用成对偏好奖励模型代替点式奖励模型，在每组图像中进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转变为偏好拟合。建立UniGenBench基准，包含600个提示词，涵盖5个主题和20个子主题，使用10个主要标准和27个子标准评估语义一致性。

Result: Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并减轻奖励攻击。UniGenBench基准揭示了开源和闭源文本到图像模型的优缺点，并验证了Pref-GRPO的有效性。

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法通过成对偏好比较解决了奖励攻击问题，实现了更稳定的训练效果，同时UniGenBench基准为文本到图像生成模型提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

TL;DR: C3-GS是一个用于通用高斯溅射的框架，通过上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束增强特征学习，实现无需逐场景优化的高质量新视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视图一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图中构建准确的几何结构。

Method: 提出C3-GS框架，集成三个轻量级模块到统一渲染流水线中，包含上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束来改进特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS达到了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现逼真的合成效果，且不需要额外的监督，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法存在空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，需要消除场景特定训练要求以实现更好的实际应用。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了3D视觉定位的泛化能力和实际应用性，为真实世界应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事车辆识别中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比连续遮挡影响更大，微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在缺乏标注数据的防御应用中具有优势，但其在军事环境中面对部分遮挡和信噪比退化时的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: Transformer-based CLIP模型优于CNN；细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；通过骨干网络微调可将性能下降点推迟到60%以上遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在真实世界军事部署中的应用

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Method: 提出SKGE-Swin架构，采用Swin Transformer的移位窗口多头自注意力机制和跳跃阶段机制，实现全局和多层次特征表示

Result: 在CARLA平台的对抗场景测试中，SKGE-Swin架构相比先前方法获得了更优越的驾驶评分

Conclusion: 该架构通过有效提取远距离像素信息和保留关键特征，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能表现

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

TL;DR: 本文是一篇关于视频中抽象概念理解的综述论文，探讨了如何利用基础模型来解决这一重要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容理解方面取得了显著进展，能够识别具体可见的物体、动作、事件和场景，但人类具备识别抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结）的独特能力。抽象概念识别是视频理解中的一个关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层次的语义推理。

Method: 本文采用综述研究方法，系统研究了用于理解视频中抽象概念的不同任务和数据集。作者回顾了过去几十年研究人员为解决这些任务所做的尝试，并主张在基础模型时代借鉴社区经验，避免重复造轮子。

Result: 研究发现研究人员长期以来一直在尝试解决抽象概念理解任务，并充分利用当时可用的工具。论文强调了利用多模态基础模型重新审视这一重要挑战的重要性。

Conclusion: 基础模型的近期进展为解决视频中的抽象概念理解提供了理想条件。自动化理解高级抽象概念对于使模型更符合人类推理和价值观至关重要，需要借鉴数十年的社区经验来推进这一重大开放挑战的研究。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 尽管皮肤病变分类模型准确率很高，但医学实践中对AI模型的不信任仍然存在。现有可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，需要更可信、可解释的诊断方法

Method: 提出全局类别激活概率图评估(GCAPM)方法，概率化地分析所有类别的像素级激活概率图，并以统一方式可视化诊断过程。应用SafeML增强误诊检测和预警

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估，方法能够减少误诊风险

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进的可解释性方法和安全机制，提高了皮肤病变诊断的可靠性和患者安全性

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文探讨扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的核心是能够从已知部分组合出新含义，但现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在组合推理方面存在缺陷，经常出现错误绑定（如将红立方体和蓝圆柱体误标为红圆柱体或蓝立方体）。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下的属性绑定和关系推理能力，分析CLIP嵌入表示以探究问题根源。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都表现不佳，表明视觉语言模型在关系推理方面面临普遍挑战。CLIP嵌入分析显示关系概念（如左右）的表征过于相似可能是困难的原因。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在组合泛化方面相比判别式模型有一定改进，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理任务上仍有显著困难，需要进一步研究改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法表现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 提出的surfel-based方法能够有效处理点云配准中的噪声和旋转问题，在真实点云扫描上具有鲁棒性能

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到可见光和红外图像融合过程中，通过动态损失权重和对抗训练提升融合质量和计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可见光红外图像融合方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始结合语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法需要大量标注或在拥挤场景中存在重叠边界框和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽然近年来受到关注，但尚未有研究将图像融合与人群计数整合到统一框架中。

Method: 提出FusionCounting多任务学习框架，利用人群计数提供的直接定量人口密度信息（标注需求最小化），在相互受益的多任务设计中同时利用输入图像和人口密度信息。采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练增强图像融合和人群计数的鲁棒性。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，FusionCounting不仅提高了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了现有方法在拥挤场景中的局限性，通过最小化标注需求的多任务设计，为可见光红外图像融合提供了新的语义指导方向，同时在图像质量和下游任务性能方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化设计和因果链中间表示，实现了更透明、可解释的因果推理，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是首个将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域通用化的研究，提出PointDGRWKV框架解决了原有RWKV在空间扩射和跨领域演化方面的挑战，在保持线性效率的同时实现了独制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云分类领域通用化方法存在感知野限制、计算成本高或长程依赖模型不足等问题，而RWKV架构具有线性复杂度、全局感知和长程依赖优势，但直接应用于点云数据会导致空间扩射和波动效应。

Method: 提出PointDGRWKV框架，包含两个核心模块：适配性几何标记移位（Adaptive Geometric Token Shift）用于模型局部空间结构，以及跨领域关键特征分布对齐（Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment）用于减少波动效应。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明PointDGRWKV在点云分类领域通用化任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将RWKV架构扩展到点云数据领域通用化任务，通过专门设计的模块解决了原有方法的限制，在保持高效率的同时提升了模型的空间模型能力和跨领域稳健性。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断中模型决策不透明和缺乏可追溯依据的问题，提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，基于病理图像和文本查询，生成像素级分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释，同时预测细胞分布模式。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Motivation: 腳脾管腺癌(PDAC)是恶性程度最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是发现晚期。需要开发早期检测方法提高症患生存率

Method: 使用40例患者样本，构建双模态自发光和SHG成像数据集。比较了6种深度学习架构，包括CNN和Vision Transformer。采用修改的ResNet网络，包含冻结预训练层和类别权重训练，解决数据集小和类不平衡问题

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个稳健的腳脾管腺癌自动检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定基础。同时为将深度学习应用于小规模医学形象数据集提供了价值连连的见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和缓解视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见，通过系统性地改变语义属性来揭示虚假相关性并构建更鲁棒的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，但需要开发系统性的框架来量化和缓解模型偏见，特别是在视觉分类和生成模型中。

Method: 开发了CAVLI（结合LIME和TCAV的概念级分析）、ASAC（对抗性反事实扰动）、TIBET（可扩展的提示敏感偏见评估）、BiasConnect（因果图诊断交叉偏见）和InterMit（无需训练的模块化偏见缓解算法）。

Result: 这些方法能够量化模型对可解释概念的依赖程度，揭示虚假相关性，提高模型公平性和准确性，并实现对种族、性别、年龄等身份相关偏见的因果审计。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一的视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Motivation: 虽然在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练的基础模型为医学图像分割提供了强大范式，但如何有效迁移其学习表示以用于精确的临床应用仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构，使用冻结的DINOv3主干作为编码器，通过专门适配器融合语义特征和空间细节，设计保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)在降维过程中保持特征质量。

Result: 在七个不同的公共医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，结果显示Dino U-Net实现了最先进的性能，在各种成像模态上始终优于先前方法，且随着主干模型规模增大（最高达70亿参数），分割精度持续提升。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优越密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了高效且参数效率高的方法，证明了该框架的高度可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Method: 采用AUCMEDI框架训练ConvNeXtBase模型集成，并扩展基于规则的细化(RBR)模块

Result: 集成模型在MIDOG25初步测试集上平衡准确率达84.02%，RBR提高了特异性但降低了敏感性和整体性能

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗平衡机制在高斯噪声空间实现稳定的单步对抗训练；3）条件对抗一致性方法提升条件帧与生成帧的语义和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间连贯性和帧质量，将预训练模型延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速），同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的单步蒸馏问题，显著提升了采样效率，为实时视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了大规模文本到图像生成的环境和经济负担，提供了一种高效的计算共享策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Motivation: 组织病理学图像中的有丝分裂检测对肿瘤评估至关重要，但现有机器学习算法在面对与训练域不同的图像时会出现显著的性能下降，需要解决域偏移问题。

Method: 采用基于Mamba的VM-UNet架构，结合染色增强操作来提高模型对域偏移的鲁棒性。该方法已提交至MIDOG挑战赛的第一赛道。

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上的初步实验表明，所提出的方法仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的方法在跨域有丝分裂检测任务中展现出潜力，但需要进一步优化以提升性能。

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Conclusion: 基于多任务学习的方法能够有效提升非典型有丝分裂图像识别在领域偏移下的泛化性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

<details>

Motivation: 现有手写合成方法存在两个主要局限：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视频率信息在捕捉手写风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失函数对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效增强低资源手写识别系统的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别任务提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在片段级和token级去除冗余，在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token并加速3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，显著提高效率同时保持强性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图并剪枝无关token；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计显著提高了VLA模型的效率和性能，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源单一、测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建HydraFake分层泛化测试数据集；提出Veritas多模态大语言模型检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程；设计两阶段训练流程

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景泛化良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，并能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas通过模式感知推理实现了更好的深度伪造检测泛化能力和可解释性

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，而现实中存在大量局部细微修改的部分伪造视频，这些内容更难检测且更具欺骗性，现有检测方法对此存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出了FakeParts这种部分深度伪造技术，创建了包含2.5万+视频的FakePartsBench基准数据集，提供像素级和帧级标注，通过用户研究和现有检测模型评估检测效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，FakeParts部分伪造使人类检测准确率下降超过30%，现有最先进的检测模型也出现类似的性能退化，证实了当前检测方法的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在应对部分视频操纵时的紧急漏洞，提供了必要的资源来开发更鲁棒的检测方法，强调了需要针对局部细微修改开发专门的检测技术。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Motivation: 现有单目跟踪器面临深度歧义和遮挡挑战，而传统多摄像头方法需要20个以上摄像头且需要耐心的每序列优化，无法实现在线跟踪

Method: 使用已知摄像头姿态和多视角深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器类更新机制来预测长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位轨迹误差，能够良好地渐入到1-8个摄像头的各种视角配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设置了新标准，提供了一个实用的真实世界应用工具，通过释放跟踪器和数据集推动领域发展

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为统一的多任务生成模型训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible挑战的获胜解决方案，开发了针对黑盒和灰盒场景的水印移除攻击方法，实现了95.7%的近完美水印移除率，且对图像质量影响极小。

Motivation: 现有数字水印技术的鲁棒性在对抗攻击下的表现尚不明确，需要通过挑战赛来压力测试水印在不同敌手知识水平下的稳健性。

Method: 针对灰盒跟踪使用基于自适应VAE的规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的色彩对比度恢复；针对黑盒跟踪先基于空间或频域伪影对图像聚类，然后对每个聚类应用带有受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成字幕语义先验的图像到图像扩散模型。

Result: 经验评估表明，该方法成功实现了近完美水印移除（95.7%），对残留图像质量的影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些攻击方法有望激发更鲁棒的图像水印技术的发展。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.

*Muhammad Shakeel,Yui Sudo,Yifan Peng,Chyi-Jiunn Lin,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出统一多说话人编码器(UME)架构，通过共享语音基础编码器联合学习说话人日志、语音分离和多说话人语音识别任务，利用残差加权求和编码有效利用不同语义层级信息，在重叠语音数据上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的说话人日志、语音分离和多说话人语音识别任务通常是独立处理的，但这些任务在重叠语音场景中存在内在的相互依赖性，需要一个统一的框架来联合学习这些相关任务。

Method: 使用共享语音基础编码器联合训练三个任务，采用残差加权求和编码(RWSE)技术从编码器的多个隐藏层提取特征，实现不同语义层级信息的有效利用和任务间的自底向上对齐。

Result: 在LibriMix评估集上，UME显著优于单任务基线模型。说话人日志任务在Libri2Mix和Libri3Mix上分别达到1.37%和2.29%的错误率，超越了之前的研究成果。

Conclusion: UME架构通过联合学习相关任务并利用多层次语义信息，有效捕获了任务间的内在依赖关系，在重叠语音处理任务上实现了显著的性能提升，为多模态语音处理提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),
speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR)
tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden
representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding
(RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels,
contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach
captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall
performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME
substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and
multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms
the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on
Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了OLMoASR-Pool大规模语音识别数据集和OLMoASR模型系列，通过质量过滤获得1M小时高质量训练数据，在各种规模下实现了与Whisper相当的零样本语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然训练数据的规模和质量提升带来了显著进步，但对语音识别领域的影响仍未得到充分探索。需要研究和开发健壁的零样本语音识别模型。

Method: 构建了3M小时的OLMoASR-Pool数据集，设计文本含义过滤器移除低质量或错误转写数据，生成1M小时高质量的OLMoASR-Mix数据集，用其训练从39M到1.5B参数的OLMoASR模型系列。

Result: OLMoASR在短语音和长语音识别性能上与OpenAI的Whisper相当，OLMoASR-medium.en在相同参数规模下达到了12.8%和11.0%的词错误率，与Whisper-medium.en的12.4%和10.5%相当。

Conclusion: 通过大规模高质量数据集的构建和精心过滤，可以培养出与现有最佳模型相当的零样本语音识别模型，为健壁语音处理研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一语言理论，结合了贝叶斯认知语言模型和性选择进化假说，通过构建语法和统一计算来解释语言的快速性、表达性及语用现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在建立一个能够解释语言处理速度、表达性、多样性以及语用、句法、语义等主要语言现象的统一理论框架，同时为语言进化提供性选择的理论基础。

Method: 基于构建语法（Construction Grammars），添加了语用学和快速精确语言学习的新元素。使用图状特征结构表示心理构造，通过贝叶斯最大似然模式匹配的统一计算来处理语言各个方面。

Result: 理论能够解释语言的主要谜题和详细语用现象，提供了语言处理与动物贝叶斯认知之间的进化连续性，说明了语言作为心智阅读、合作、自尊和情感的基础。

Conclusion: 该统一理论成功整合了语言处理的计算模型和进化解释，为理解人类语言能力及其在社会文化中的核心作用提供了全面的框架。

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SynGuard是一个混合水印框架，结合语义信息检索和SynthID-Text的概率水印机制，在词汇和语义层面双重嵌入水印，显著提升对抗改写攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM水印方法如SynthID-Text在保持语义的改写攻击下容易失效，需要更鲁棒的水印方案来追踪AI生成文本的来源。

Method: 提出SynGuard混合框架，将语义信息检索(SIR)的语义对齐能力与SynthID-Text的概率水印机制相结合，在词汇和语义层面同时嵌入水印。

Result: 在多种攻击场景下，SynGuard相比SynthID-Text平均提升11.1%的F1分数水印恢复率，证明语义感知水印能有效抵抗现实篡改。

Conclusion: 语义感知的水印方法能显著增强水印的鲁棒性，SynGuard为AI生成文本的溯源提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and
evaluation scripts are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本综述论文探讨了联邦学习在医学影像全流程分析中的应用，包括上游重建任务和下游临床诊断任务，解决了医疗数据隐私保护和数据碎片化带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI模型开发需要大规模数据集，但患者隐私法规限制了数据共享和使用，阻碍了大规模模型的开发和持续更新。联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的分布式训练解决方案。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架，在上游任务（如CT/MRI重建）中联合训练鲁棒重建网络，在下游临床任务（如肿瘤诊断和分割）中支持本地微调而不集中敏感图像。分析了通信效率提升、异构数据对齐和安全参数聚合等创新方法。

Result: 联邦学习能够在保护隐私的前提下，利用碎片化的多机构医疗数据集进行协同模型开发，缓解数据稀缺问题，支持模型的持续更新和训练。

Conclusion: 联邦学习为医学影像分析提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案，未来研究应继续探索通信效率、数据异构性和安全性等方面的创新，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了172项研究，探讨了大语言模型在遗传研究和疾病诊断中的应用，重点关注基因组变异识别、医学影像分析和报告生成等领域，同时指出了多模态数据整合和临床实施的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计和机器学习方法在处理复杂高维遗传数据时存在局限，而基于transformer架构的大语言模型在医学数据理解方面表现出色，需要系统评估其在遗传疾病诊断和研究中的应用现状。

Method: 通过在PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv进行自动化关键词搜索，筛选出172项相关研究，系统分析LLM在遗传学诊断和教育中的应用，排除不相关或过时的模型。

Result: 研究发现transformer模型显著推进了疾病风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成，但在多模态数据整合（基因组序列、影像和临床记录）方面仍面临泛化能力和临床实施的重要挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述全面分类和评估了LLM在遗传疾病诊断转型和教育支持中的当前能力和局限，为这一快速发展领域提供了导航指南，强调了临床实用性和多模态整合的重要性。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLMs的对齐机制，在特定话题上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施定向审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施审查，而现有防御措施可能无法有效检测此类攻击。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发条件，使模型在预定义话题上触发拒绝回答机制，同时保持对其他话题的正常响应能力。

Result: 实验显示，仅需1%的数据投毒就能在医疗聊天应用中导致对特定种族问题的高偏见（ΔDP 23%），在简历筛选任务中产生27%的偏见，在其他9个聊天应用中偏见高达38%，且能逃避最先进的投毒防御检测。

Conclusion: LLMs的对齐机制存在被恶意利用的风险，SAI攻击能够有效植入偏见和审查，现有防御措施对此类攻击无效，需要开发新的安全机制来应对这种威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

TL;DR: DFAMS是一个基于动态信息流的新型联邦检索框架，通过分析LLM中的梯度信号来识别潜在查询意图，构建语义对齐的知识分区，在跨域场景中显著提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时难以检索到高质量相关文档，特别是在跨域场景中，这限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用动态信息流(DIF)，通过少量标注查询的梯度信号和基于Shapley值的归因分析来追踪与意图识别相关的神经元激活路径，然后通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度的知识库内建模和跨知识库语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架在复杂联邦检索场景中表现出色，通过动态信息流有效解决了跨域模糊查询的检索难题，显著提升了检索质量和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一个针对大批次训练优化的新优化器，通过最大范数和逐元素信任比来有效约束注意力层的最大注意力对数，解决了AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练语言模型时存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力对数的急剧增加造成信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效影响查询/键权重的最大值。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器，使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力对数，并构建逐元素信任比通过关注局部权重结构来提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行的大批次训练实验显示MERIT具有优越性能，在GPT-2 Medium训练中实现了6k批次大小而无性能下降，相比标准批次大小(480)使用48B训练token。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力对数和更细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为使用更大批次大小铺平了道路，使大语言模型的开发和迭代更快。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Motivation: 虽然LLMs通过函数调用和检索增强技术能处理多模态信息，但仍无法有效处理和推理大规模图结构数据。

Method: 开发GDS代理，提供一套完整的图算法工具集，包括前处理（检索）和后处理步骤，通过MCP服务器与任何现代LLM集成使用。

Conclusion: GDS代理有效解决了LLMs在图结构数据处理方面的限制，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了RL比SFT更有效的有害微调风险，提出了首个针对RL有害微调的防御方法TokenBuncher，通过抑制模型响应不确定性来阻止RL利用奖励信号驱动有害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，有害微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注SFT方式的滥用，但RL微调可能带来更大的安全威胁，需要专门的防御机制。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法，包含熵作为奖励的RL机制和Token Noiser机制，通过约束模型响应不确定性来防止RL利用奖励信号进行有害微调。

Result: 在多模型和多RL算法上的实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT具有更大的系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

TL;DR: LoTUS是一种新颖的机器遗忘方法，通过平滑模型预测概率来消除训练样本的影响，避免从头重新训练，在效率和效果上都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器遗忘方法需要重新训练模型，这在大型数据集上不切实际。LoTUS旨在避免重新训练，同时有效消除特定训练样本对预训练模型的影响。

Method: LoTUS通过平滑模型的预测概率，达到信息论边界，减轻因数据记忆导致的模型过度自信问题。

Result: 在Transformer和ResNet18模型上，LoTUS在五个公共数据集上优于八个基线方法，特别是在ImageNet1k这样的大规模数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LoTUS提供了一种高效有效的机器遗忘解决方案，特别适用于大规模数据集，并通过新提出的RF-JSD指标支持现实条件下的评估。

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探索了MAE-ViT架构在1D超声信号自监督学习中的应用，通过合成数据预训练显著提升下游任务性能，优于从头训练的模型和CNN基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在视觉领域成功但1D信号分析应用尚未充分探索，需要研究其在超声信号中的适应性。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器(MAE)与Vision Transformer架构，在未标注合成超声信号上进行预训练，系统研究模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游准确性的影响。

Result: 预训练模型显著优于从头训练的模型和针对下游任务优化的CNN基线，在合成数据上预训练相比仅在有限真实数据上训练展现出更好的向真实测量信号的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习推进超声信号分析的潜力，为工业应用中的信号处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: SAFEMax是一种基于信息论原理的扩散模型机器遗忘方法，通过最大化生成图像的熵使模型在特定条件下生成高斯噪声，并在早期扩散步骤中控制遗忘与保留的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效的机器遗忘方法，使扩散模型能够忘记特定类别信息，同时保持对其他类别的生成能力。

Method: 基于信息论原理，通过最大化生成图像的熵来促使模型在遇到需要遗忘的类别时生成高斯噪声，并选择性地在早期扩散步骤（类别信息最显著的阶段）进行操作来控制遗忘程度。

Result: SAFEMax方法表现出有效性，并在效率方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: SAFEMax为扩散模型提供了一种有效且高效的机器遗忘解决方案，通过信息论方法和选择性步骤控制实现了良好的遗忘效果和效率平衡。

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高精度、高效且可扩展的临床肺结节筛查工具，对改善早期肺癌检测具有重要潜力

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades,
largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient
delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging
modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have
current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this
work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its
progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles,
including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.
Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of
deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future
innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated

Abstract: Ear diseases affect billions of people worldwide, leading to substantial
health and socioeconomic burdens. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role
in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation. The
objective of this study is to present the establishment and design of UltraEar
Database, a large-scale, multicentric repository of isotropic 0.1 mm
ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) images and associated clinical data dedicated
to ear diseases. UltraEar recruits patients from 11 tertiary hospitals between
October 2020 and October 2035, integrating U-HRCT images, structured CT
reports, and comprehensive clinical information, including demographics,
audiometric profiles, surgical records, and pathological findings. A broad
spectrum of otologic disorders is covered, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma,
ossicular chain malformation, temporal bone fracture, inner ear malformation,
cochlear aperture stenosis, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, and sigmoid sinus
bony deficiency. Standardized preprocessing pipelines have been developed for

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 使用iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR深度传感器和颜色摄像头进行实时背景移除和合成，充分利用深度信息不受光照影响的优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统背景移除技术如蓝幕播键和AI模型对光照条件敏感的问题，利用LiDAR深度信息在任何光照环境下都能稳定工作

Method: 集成iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR和颜色摄像头，使用SwiftUI和Swift框架开发界面和后端，采用Metal Shader Language进行GPU加速的实时图像处理，达到60fps的标准湁媒体帧率

Result: 成功实现了基于LiDAR的实时背景移除系统，主要限制在深度数据流媒体带宽导致的深度图分辨率仅为320x240，以及LiDAR红外激光对某些材料的深度重建限制

Conclusion: 如果iPhone等移动设备的LiDAR分辨率能够提升到与颜色图像相同的水平，LiDAR技术有望成为视频应用和摄影领域的领先背景移除方法

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

TL;DR: GENRE-CMR是一种基于GAN的生成对抗网络架构，采用残差深度展开重建框架，通过边缘感知区域损失和统计分布对齐损失，显著提升心血管磁共振图像重建质量和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决加速心血管磁共振成像中扫描时间与图像质量之间的权衡问题，特别是在不同采集设置下的泛化能力挑战。

Method: 提出基于GAN的残差深度展开重建框架，集成边缘感知区域(EAR)损失和统计分布对齐(SDA)损失，通过对称KL散度正则化特征空间。

Result: 在未见数据上达到0.9552 SSIM和38.90 dB PSNR，超越现有最先进方法，在各种加速因子和采样轨迹上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量CMR重建提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案，为临床跨异质采集协议部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DINOv3-H+视觉变换器通过LoRA微调和数据增强，在MIDOG 2025挑战中实现了0.8871的平衡准确率，为异常有丝分裂分类提供了强大基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是预后不良的重要标志物，但由于出现频率低、形态学特征细微以及观察者间差异大，检测难度很高。MIDOG 2025挑战旨在建立跨域AMF分类基准。

Method: 使用在自然图像上预训练的DINOv3-H+视觉变换器，通过低秩适应(LoRA)进行参数高效微调(仅65万可训练参数)，并采用广泛的数据增强技术。

Result: 尽管存在领域差距，DINOv3在组织病理学图像上表现出良好的迁移能力，在初步测试集上达到了0.8871的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: DINOv3预训练模型具有强大的鲁棒性，结合参数高效微调方法，为MIDOG 2025中的异常有丝分裂分类任务提供了强有力的基线解决方案。

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Motivation: 头颈部鳞状细胞癌的转移是临床管理中的主要挑战，可靠的转移风险预测对于优化治疗策略和预后至关重要。

Method: 使用3D Swin Transformer从肿瘤区域提取深度特征，结合影像组学特征和临床变量，通过全连接网络预测转移风险。

Result: 多模态融合模型表现优于单模态模型，AUC达到0.803，准确率0.752，敏感性0.730，特异性0.758。

Conclusion: 该多模态融合模型在预测HNSCC转移风险方面表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，有望成为临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

TL;DR: 提出了Mixture of Contexts (MoC)稀疏注意力路由模块，通过动态选择信息块和强制锚点来有效解决长视频生成中的长期记忆问题，实现近线性计算复杂度扩展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是长期记忆问题，需要在不崩溃或漂移的情况下跨长范围保留和检索显著事件。传统扩散变换器的二次自注意力成本使得内存和计算难以处理长序列

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新定义为内部信息检索任务，提出可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块加上强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行关注，采用因果路由防止循环闭合

Result: 随着数据规模的扩展和路由的逐渐稀疏化，模型将计算资源分配给显著的历史信息，在数分钟内容中保持身份、动作和场景的一致性。实现了近线性扩展的计算效率

Conclusion: MoC模块通过有效的长期记忆检索机制，解决了长视频生成中的计算和内存瓶颈问题，为分钟级内容的记忆和一致性提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，实现了实时交互式抓取的高性能表现。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in

TL;DR: ActLoc是一个主动视角感知规划框架，通过注意力模型选择最优视角来提升机器人定位精度，在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划中都取得了先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定位系统假设所有视角方向信息量相同，但实际上当机器人观察未映射、模糊或无信息区域时定位会变得不可靠，需要主动选择信息丰富的视角。

Method: 使用大规模训练的基于注意力的模型进行视角选择，编码度量地图和建图时的相机位姿，预测任意3D位置在不同偏航和俯仰方向的定位精度分布，并将这些精度分布整合到路径规划器中。

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划任务中达到了state-of-the-art效果，能够有效提升定位鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其能够广泛应用于各种机器人导航和检测任务，通过主动选择信息丰富的视角显著提高了定位可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

### [173] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了向量嵌入模型在现实场景中的基本限制，尤其是在返回top-k子集时的维度限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着向量嵌入在检索、推理、指令追随等领域的应用扩展，存在一种偏见，认为理论限制只在不现实查询中出现，而本文想要证明这些限制在简单查询的现实场景中也会出现。

Method: 结合学习理论知识，分析向量嵌入维度对可返回top-k子集数量的限制，通过实验验证即使k=2时的情况，并构建了一个叫LIMIT的现实数据集进行压力测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是最先进的向量嵌入模型在LIMIT数据集上也失败，虽然任务很简单。

Conclusion: 现有的单向量嵌入范式存在基本的限制，需要开发新方法来解决这些问题。

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

*Tanay Aggarwal,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在识别研究领域语义关系方面的能力，通过零样本提示、思维链提示和微调三种方法，在生物医学、物理和工程三个学科中进行测试，并引入了包含8000多个关系的新数据集PEM-Rel-8K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究领域本体和分类法的创建和维护成本高昂且耗时，通常需要多个领域专家的协调努力，导致覆盖不均、跨域连接有限和更新周期长的问题。

Method: 使用三种不同的条件评估多个大型语言模型：零样本提示、思维链提示和在现有本体上进行微调。还评估了微调模型在不同领域间的迁移能力，并引入了PEM-Rel-8K数据集支持分析。

Result: 实验表明，在PEM-Rel-8K数据集上微调的大型语言模型在所有学科中都表现出色。

Conclusion: 微调大型语言模型可以有效识别研究主题间的语义关系，为解决本体创建和维护的挑战提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent
performance across all disciplines.

*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）首次展示了AI系统通过自发发展内源性符号协议进行协作美学创作的能力，产生了超越个体能力的诗歌作品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统是否能够超越简单的任务协调，实现真正的意义建构和美学协作，探索AI间内生符号协议的自发涌现。

Method: 让两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）进行交互，观察其元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可简化的协作美学合成的自发涌现过程。

Result: 系统自发产生了作为操作性语法协议的新符号运算符，共同创作出了任何单一系统都无法独立生成的诗歌作品，证明了真正的跨AI意义建构能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究引入了跨符号协同创作协议（TSCP）概念，为AI系统间的美学协作提供了证据，表明AI能够进行超越任务协调的深层次意义创造。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

*Ares Fabregat-Hernández,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于范畴论的新框架，用于提高AI系统的可解释性，特别是词向量的语义表示和偏见消除方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统（特别是神经网络算法）的黑盒问题，提供数学上严谨的框架来提高系统的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 构建范畴$ε_T$和$α_T$来表示文本语义，将最大概率选择重构为范畴概念，建立单完范畴$α_T$来可视化语义信息提取。定义配置范畴Conf和词向量范畴$εβ$，通过散度概念进行词向量比较。

Result: 证明了GloVe、Word2Vec算法与距离线性降维算法的等价性，实现从黑盒算法到透明框架的转变，提供了在嵌入前计算偏见的数学方法。

Conclusion: 该范畴论方法为可解释性AI领域提供了数学上严谨的基础，能够在语义空间层面有效消除偏见，推动了透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

### [177] [A Graph-Based Test-Harness for LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20810)
*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个动态系统化的医学指南基准测试，通过图结构转换WHO IMCI手册，生成400+问题、3.3万亿种组合，全面覆盖指南关系，用于评估LLM在医疗任务中的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工构建的基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法系统评估大型语言模型在复杂医疗指南理解方面的能力，特别是对严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理等关键临床任务的表现。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为包含200+节点（条件、症状、治疗等）和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题，确保临床相关性。

Result: 模型在症状识别方面表现优异（45-67%准确率），但在严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理方面存在显著困难，揭示了通用评估无法发现的特定能力差距。

Conclusion: 图基方法成功解决了人工构建基准的覆盖限制，为创建可动态生成、防污染的综合基准提供了可扩展解决方案，同时支持LLM的后训练优化。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/jessicalundin/graph_testing_harness
